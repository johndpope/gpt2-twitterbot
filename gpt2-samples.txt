======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
Grembock's Delicatessen in Austin, Texas, just opened its doors Sunday night for the first full week in business since being founded on Aug. 30. A volunteers-only open house event, there was no event at the South Congress restaurant yesterday, and no information to be had about what's cooking either. The only Tweet on the site belongs to Grembock's longtime associate Josh Laner, who sent some "Welcome home" postcards to patrons on from the head chef Thomas Ghia.

However, ABC Channel 7 in Austin's Austin360 segment on Grembock's posted a photo of (curiously not pictured) a neatly made 7-course meal on the menu. Eater reached out to Grembock's management for additional info. After a bit of back-and-forth, we learned that the menu(s) is still in the works but it's still months away from opening day. We are counting on reports of food violations trending under "things that will happen" for this to be real.

Just after midnight after announcing two weeks ago that it would be open to the public, Grembock's became the first Austin restaurant to ride a ride-sharing service in Austin since the "Bike-Share — Share the Ride" controversy erupted. Upon searching Austin traffic data numbers for drivers who picked up customers from Grembock's during the Sunday evening opening period, we also learned it was the first time an Uber picked up an Uber at Grembock's since Josh Laner threw out his hat for himself as the head chef when the restaurant opened. The fact that Uber picked up an Uber at Facebook's Austin offices may be reason for concern but so is the fact that Uber doesn't officially operate in Austin. With the clear safety record of Uber versus Lyft — and Grembock's reputation for superior, enticing food around town — it's premature to put your faith in the ride-sharing app's ability to coexist as a competing competitor.

Owner Thomas Gamm…

Here is a bit of information we have learned so far. A rough menu has been spent firming up menu items for the full week. We've seen a few concepts give us glimpses of what their menus may look like. The seven courses have not been revealed but you can assume Friday, Saturday, and Sunday lunch menu items will feature small plates. The breakfast menu is on the way, and dessert. For the week, Gamm says he anticipates hundreds of guests to tuck into the Cheeseburger tots, Potato Smothered Chicken Fabulous, Shrimp Rabonata, Crispy Boiled Salmon, Artisan Steak Ravioli, and Grilled Manchurian.

Initial plans were for a 21j-caliber Denver breweries with a run-down bar next to the kitchen, but that venue is no longer happening. He says he has set up a possible evening gracious seating deal with Rossi Library Options for more comfortable hours. Other than those two things, Chef Gamm did not indicate what we should expect. An opener date?

There were Vegan fans of Kitchen Frusciante's Sean Brock – a burger joint that was slated to open on South Congress – who remained skeptical about Grembock's's plans for vegan options. Brock tweeted late last week, "I learned Grembock's is going to be vegetarian – ugh."

Like Austin, Grembock's is in the middle of its own food crisis. Financial turmoil is staving off some long-mistreated neighbors in the Austin area by continuing to spring fresh people onto its shores, but it also comes with that hardest-to-beat feeling of "I will always take a chance on what Austin's gonna have next" the deeper you look into the Austin food scene. Luckily, there are now three other East Austin restaurants that have been given the finger for food-quality supervision and acquisition. We hope that staff will be friendly after Saturday's opening and if you're looking for good meaty vegan food with a familiar Austin vibe, Grembock's is the one big regular-spot on a weird hobo dinner crawl.<|endoftext|>It was a few nights later that I realized the disappointment in my soul, what could I do? What were the options? We had seen the state-of-the museum, so why not visit the State Legislature? As a young kid I had been part of the first protest to interrupt a visit of President Kennedy. But not so far away, the administration allowed homosexuals to be employed in the military, the same as the ticket gone this afternoon. How could I shatter people's trust in them, I wondered. Yet, you would think that the designers of the World Heritage Site could come up with programs to encourage the visitors to visit the inside of the Capitol. But there were no results, not at least that we could find.

More than 95 percent of iPhone 6 preorders being held by Apple's INPEX, Shanghai

Apple now joins current Apple partner Pegatron(s tan), which already employed the same iPhone generation strategy to ensure ample supply for iPhones.

TOP MOBILE NEWS: Apple TM already used generation-from-graphics approach to keep iPhone supply robust

Pegatron, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer for Apple, can leverage its experience in supplying parts and components for major electronics companies like Nokia and Sony. In addition, it can rely on the redundancies provided by a single contract.

Pegatron already secured 90 percent of iPhone 6 preorders from INPEX at the beginning of October, an executive from INPEX told Reuters. "Whole Julination has to cover one iPhone 6 unit," he said. "This week, I don't have the capacity for 4 people to sell a unit."

Of course, it's unbelievably tough to find new qualities when rain doesn't fall. So when it comes to the iPhone's next generation, basically every chipmaker will be utilizing "higher-end characteristics" in part of the production process in order to deliver up to 30 percent more processing power for more impressive performance and battery life. And it's not just a matter of using new packaging materials; Apple will be using a second generation LCD touchpanels as well.

DETROIT — A trial to determine if people accused of murder can get access to money during their court cases has resulted in decisions to be appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court.

Photos and schematics first revealed late last year show 46-year-old Denise Schroeder frantically waving a .38 caliber revolver during a harrowing confrontation with a masked intruder. The incident, which occurred back in 2011, left Schroeder and her boyfriend, Krzysztof Levine, dead.

On Thursday, attorneys representing Synder and Andrea Almon, Lisa Tenore, Glenn Sanderson, Heather Derry, and Robbie Mecham, met with attorneys for Ronald Pirone, Schroeder's boyfriend, the Morning Call first reported. Pirone sat in the courtroom throughout the proceeding and still has nonchalance as the proceedings continue.

Scott Kyser, Coordinator of the Governor Wine and Spirits Task Force, said that by Wednesday, lawsuits brought about by Curig's involvement have been consolidated too.

"This makes it easier to continue the process, but in two separate cases," Kyser said.

While the state Supreme Court is demanding that Curig reappear down the road, opponents to the cases are "completely focused on moving forward," Ostap Safar, Schroeder's loved one, said before the proceedings.

Dannielle Schroeder, a number of family and acquaintances of the victim have said she had a difficult childhood. Synder worked at a Mintz law firm at or near Schroeder's family's home in Bridgwater, New Jersey during her childhood.

"[She] never had any money...and had nobody to cook for her or to lift her up when she struggled," grandmother Frances told WECT last month, adding that she only learned Schroeder's name since my younger daughter decided to come clean about her parents' murder.

One particular incident occurred at age six. When the rest of the family in the neighborhood crowded around Almon in front of his grandparents' home, Schroeder was at home alone. Almon, out late drinking with friends, decided to sneak in. But there was a huge three-foot wooden fence around the house. Almon got a prosthetic leg and made a clumsy climb over the fence. To make his escape, Almon reached the second story balcony and, he told police, ended up in the kitchen on the first floor.

According to the Morning Call, Schroeder, her mother, Schwarzbitz and her stepfather, Frank Berger were drinking the night of November 24, 2011. Almon reportedly called the Schroeder home at about 10:30 on to call the children, in the safety of the car. Instead Almon got into the pool room in the rear of the house and TOLD his family to "Suck it". Berger found Schroeder unresponsive, according to the report. Schmidt committed suicide the next day.

"Andrea was at work with her supervisor when she became separated from Elise, but she had called her that morning...[and] Elise had informed her at that point that maybe Andrea called her but not in time to retrieve her at the know place," said Fitzgerald Sherwood, representing Dannielle Schroeder at one point on Wednesday. "So Andrea became upset and better get back and found an excuse to get in the pool bathroom."

Schroeder tried to use the white boards by the pool to climb out to the balcony.

She escaped from the bedroom, and sheriff's deputies Bradley, Moore and [Danbury Police Chief Frederick] Goode arrested her.

Until a brief series of tweets surfaced on Thursday night, it had been unclear whether the U.S. senator from Ohio was being investigated for corruption, (as Rolling Stone incorrectly reported) or a tax question (as 11alive.com claimed).

John McCain has been at the center of a firestorm of reports concerning possible corruption, and he's been accused of failing to pay tax deductions by multiple media outlets. We lost track of who was tweeting. Here they are, with a short explanation of what's going on, from 11alive.com:

9:03 p.m. — Alaska

Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski became the first "serious" name in the national political media drama to call for McCain to cooperate with Senate colleagues by either disclosing his tax returns or cooperating with what she called the "full force" of the "IRS, DOJ, FBI, etc."

9:05 p.m. — Legal bombshell revealed

Citing testimony from IRS attorneys last week, CNN says it has been told senators have run into a problem with "corrupt transactions" and that those facts suggest "McCain should disclose tax transactions in question." This followed the Senate Finance Committee meeting earlier this month, where Federal Treasury Inspector General J. Russell George outlined the trouble that could arise if a conservative group paid McCain campaign staffers but somehow was retroactively challenged for filing too many delinquent 2015 tax returns.

9:10 p.m. — Gizmodo

Sarah Westwood, then director of The Open Society Foundation and now a columnist at Gizmodo, writes that "hiding McCain's tax details for 25 years could cost the government [10] million dollars a year in taxes" — 12th-highest among the more than 300 senators currently receiving less than $100,000 annually in campaign deductions.

9:19 p.m. — Omaha Call-Shiller

So who paid for the glasses Franken installed in his new Senate office? Adelson at 1154, according to veteran U.S Congressmen, who say Adelson's demands are usually guaranteed at 150 percent of the normal sale price. Ron Johnson's firm Wisconsin Growth is also listed as the architect's broker. Meanwhile, Negligent Dun-Ducks is the glass display buyer

9:27 p.m. — Tax laws may be changed when the McCain committee is finished

Senator Lindsey Graham has been calling for a short investigation of claims that McCain has grown wealthy while pretending to be a war veteran and seal hunter. It came out today that each of the anonymous former staffers is getting 73 percent pre-tax profit on their deals, according to a Washington Examiner report, which led to the report that says "John McCain spent millions of dollars on gifts from donors and lobbyists and used his office to try to extract the maximum fine to keep his business going."

9:41 p.m. — Paul Mitchell explains why McCain needs to disclose his taxes

Why is the McCain tax issue a big one's on news outlets' radar? Business Insider's Paul Parilla says that First Quarter Tax Report of 2016 was released this morning.

The report was stating that the 38 a Russian oligarchs and the 157 foreign owners and non-residents delivered $380.5 billion in 13 states — 114% of dollars received.

This is actually easier to do than you think! Go out and get the leftovers of a roast or something of that nature. Parboil them for a little while. (That's what I did, if you were curious) Heat up your wok in the $medium hotish flame, drizzle in some oil, then toss the contents of the too-long messy roast for about 10 seconds or so. The wok will release steam and some surface starch which will help the stir fry singe. Spread the rice in your wok, the aromatics and proteins will absorb the undigested starch, so it will help the starch brown nicely. When all the rice-starch is brown and the rice is smooth and tender, fold in the dried white beans. It's that easy! You can even add in some fresh broccoli or other dark green veggies if you want a rich yet quick wrap soup. If you put a little more, like I did, the brown stuff willy-nilly over everything , which will color the right rainbow. Besides, it's are nicely flavored with the rice and dried lentils, not with expensive, too-frequent imported beans. I like to bring it all to a boil and let it sit more than an hour or so.

Here's how:

Lay down your Thanksgiving non-farmageddon winter block.

This should of course be a tall, blooming scrapercap block, which I did. It produces a lot of small twiggyoaks, and a few great blossoms in winter.

Hang it up into the right kind of hoop above a hot (not dry) flower bed, where the air is always humid (coffee shop) and a balmy (80 degree) breeze will blow. These tombstones cheerfully Harry Potterized out of the non-farmageddon block are well worth re-growing.

Still, you want the nooks and crannies to flower too, so for those places, set your ground cover more far back (I am always sooo sorry when I choose wrong.) and get a bigger block, and then you can then sneak bunch planting into those nooks and crannies too.

As for overall mass planting, of course, its much easier say; I urge you to experiment with fertilizing, both in general fertilizer AND specific organic crew-cut fertilizer, though organic crew-cut seems to be a regional specialty.

I make mine from composted coconut husks. They're about half as expensive as standard stuff, and have the same chemical long-lasting durability for most farm stuff. As my companion Gail tells me, organic fertilizers for it have changed since I last sold O. The containerized organic fertilizer they use now just cheapies. Encyclometall Hyde for me has seen their market boom, and I had to be ok with willing like rentals and desperation off that diets of drunk diagnostics and animal research stuff that they encourage, so it's nice to have a low-tech fertilizer for a team-builder.

Quick note though: organic fertilizers are great to use for small soil health, but only for forest soils?

Whether it's a permanent soil hopper, or a super high-volume being driven to a nightstand for maintenance out of just a bag or bucketful… I always like to use a "hybrid" fertilizer method.

I store organic fertilizer as granules buried directly in the ground. Two primary reasons:

For theft-heavy spring weeks I hate to dig little tears into those garden beds with the heels of my gardening tools, but a groundminemaker granule will get buried deep, and by definition, so deep permanently! 😉

I knife bigger chunks out of the soil, or send them directly down to the herb garden so that I can plant the bigger cuttings from those seeds. This works great for after shearing in pasture as fertilizer kills the sheathed overwinter buds, which are nice weed-eating manna for me next summer. For peony work, propane can be a baby duster of sorts, which works especially well too when properly mixed with topsoil that will naturally impregnate the cuttings and it dries into hard frothy hardened poof. The cuttings wilt as the sun comes out in spring and fall months during this time of year, and be tall, stiff knobby things, but it also helps me speed up doing next summer's pea work.

Together I've learned that damp soil that doesn't move when I had my machine pounding it into the ground makes soil too porous and good for weeds, and so I instinctively substitute wet drier dirt.

It was with these thoughts that last summer, I fortified my landscape with Japanese flowers. The

DHAKA: Thousands of people marched through Dhaka on Thursday, many decked in the colours of the semi-arid northern region marked by the drought-stricken region's tallest mountains.

"We are raising the flag of support for this drought-hit region as droughts are intense in many parts of the country. Drought in different regions is a reflection of poor policy-making," said Haji Tutul Tongkolsuri, Muslim area secretary of Bangladesh who attended the rally which grew further as people marched from different districts, including Dhaka's Shahbag area.

The march was organized by groups from various parties and ideologies, including Ultra-nationalism, Falangism, Sunni Islmaism, Hard-line Islam and Far-Right European Union.

In several in Dhaka's elite streets leading to the Shahbag march, cannons and bullet-proof shields doubled up throwing Rocks and Molotov cocktails in multiple directions. Akash Zahid, a senior pro-Rohithwarrior faction leader of Mashalit society said, "Our worry is an encroachment on our territory. To protect against pressure, the protesters stage fatalities such as solidarity and street festival."

"People would kill people who trespassed Indian territory," said Jayashree Haldar, 19-year-old student. "Sportsmen worry if the foreign teams would enter our territory as lesser referendums would also get nullified in such cases."

The rally had also attracted support from the Hindu wing of BNP, Rashtriya Mahila Janta Party, Shura-u-Shukran, Prosperity for all and Tehn Kamar Party.

Kizilbash leader Kazi Sirajul Islam Alam praised the start of the protest. "Protest grows only when main parties fail to solve our issue. We don't want money from the Centre or Darul Aman. We are fed up of being denied our rights. We are suffering from elections just because our stance is common," Alam said.

Dhaka District Magistrate Wacik Galyana said, Dhaka Police is trying to avoid going into a conflict situation but a law and order situation is being prepared in the coming days.<|endoftext|>Source: ZOO/Lina Hadid

Sources have claimed the backstage sequence to The Natural Beauty Of Sheepshead Bay set by ZOO recently, was staged using CGI – and critics are calling it an example of the use of invented CGI by the production team.

"The load in the backstage was computer generated! It tells a complete story and creates a complete world for the audience to explore," ZOO creative director Peta Blaney tweeted on Wednesday.

The Material Animals union last month called on the BBC to properly investigate claims that advertisements placed on the set were non-existent.

His statements is containing repellent falsehoods and fallacious reasoning, so much so that even hides his name and references references to his blog under unrelated articles. His points are dishonest, inaccurate and extremely false, and he really needs to be condemned for his behavior. Here we go…..

Dobman takes the opportunity to bring into discussion the extent to which Miranda warnings are being interpreted broadly by everyone - the courts and police, and the morality of most prosecutors entirely irrelevant. Please click here for my statement on it.

If the prevailing interpretation of a suspect's Miranda rights is that the suspect is obliged not to confess anything that could be used against him in court then arrest of all criminal suspects is unfair and unproductive.


"It is old fashioned, here!", he says. A much more accurate point would be that the prevailing interpretation of a confession could be used against the suspect before trial, but anytime a suspect has the

Recently, the Kraus Center for the Study of Contemporary Europe published a study entitled Recent European and Central American Divisions in Political Rights, Constitutional Democracy in a Globalized World: Protecting Post-Communist Human Rights in a Post-Civil Society. They used data from Central America and Central European countries on civil society response to mass state repression after the collapse of the Cold War and even before. Such data surprised many who condemn regime change in the Middle East, where the United States has done so since the War on Terror.

What makes the study, along with previous research, especially fascinating is its revelation of growing claims of outside interference in redress of state responsibility. For example: provincial governments established to deal with crimes against humanity after the Second World War began to enforce. Further, civil society movements and advocacy groups first dealt with state complicity after the direct and indirect support of sanctions regimes. This part is confused with the "post-conflict" period. As earlier discussion illustrated, genocide-prone states that torture and/or kill already existed. This activism was with the perspective of initiating further such atrocities in the coming years. The present case is even more important since it may seem somewhat new; that of interference in civil society's resistance to genocide and/or excessive use of force.

In the summary, above you will see that later events cannot be ignored in assessing the consequences of intervention. They implicated just as much as 1984-1989 unravelling the Soviet Union.

Evidently, we are mere years away from an intervention in Central America commencing directly from Washington. In fact, President Obama is ready to send US troops into the region. But this should not be a surprise to anyone familiar with American approach to Latin America and how it is predicated on friendly but firm monarchies. With a few exceptions, territory allows the US project of covert ops in Middle America to continue using well-muscled local proxies.

Gene Sharp (mass murder in producer94 certain rate that it would have already occurred under totalitarianism) includes a description of U.S. involvement in Cuba with a support of ex-Communist forces committing violence. The problem is not, as currently defined from Belarus to Northern Zambia, a Bay of Pigs-sized figure on a liberal per capita scale of globalization committed by a traditional enemy to assuage some private grievance. U.S. government policy is driven by latent personal utility, a tennis match to Hollywood records. Nothing in Domestic and International Law, Civil Society, and Laws of War/War Violence Prohibit that intervention in regimes which engage in gross repression will lead inexorably to intervention at some time with subsequent "regime change".

Even more alarming is Israel's role in labeling and slaughtering Palestinians. Zygmunt Bauman reports conver needed more carefully than much. However, Barak Felshit reveals how Israel's attempts to pigeonhole Palestinians as terrorists provide a basis for regular UN approbation of Israeli lashing out against Palestinian terrorism. He reports that the 2008 "Special Report" of the UN Human Rights Council very broadly called Israel "a state in violation of international human rights and humanitarian law". The purpose is to soften the demand for action against alleged Israeli human rights crimes by use of the veil of Law of Self Defense. If that were the exclusive concern of the UN, the entire notion of stubborn traps hitting for Global Windows to GLOBAL WINDS would not exist.

Recently, addressing the U.N. human rights body, the official line of Israeli spokespersons continues to be that a policy of settling Palestinians in a future Palestine that goes beyond "just managing" their people's legitimate official access to their former homeland falls under international law, barring anything beyond that. Prominently shrieking "tolerance undersold" immolates a literal shadow on the underlying terms, a semblance of civil society protection, a reality-free nonsensical universe where "mere management" of a ruined situation is prescribed economic justice at the ends rather than given proper technical human and monetary compensation and all the other things mandated by civil society.If Israel is indeed institutionalizing human rights violations, it is not only violating it's own post-fallish international law, but signalling throughout the world to perjure verbal howls indignant about the abuse of economic warfare to quell guerrilla operations. If Israel is trying to now out-lawyer the United States, it may oblige us to flip the proposition into humanity itself.

I once had the honour of hosting a big South Korean event at my house. The guest of honour was a guy I had met at a local convention. Over in Korea, especially in Seoul, there are certain words that are so ubiquitous you'll be hard pressed to spot them in casual conversations.

To them, "잠병" is what I call "긩다" / gos-ih, again a way of saying "why" or "what's going on?" Gosh, what a mouth full!

So first, let's go over some Korean words from the internet dictionary. Next, let's dig into this more detailed example and have a look at what different endings mean to Koreans.

Ik, they're saying

아, i

소, you

애, me

습, you're them

기, how or when

기억, how did you (singular term, see original)

긷, what (as in an exact time period)

이반, country

2nd person pronoun: ~(은) 답

(Oh! When I think about this, it's why I'm here! – EXO)

가, what if

Korean terms Remark Note Minjeong Gimmi [덎종가다] An old South Korean bear model. Bottom of pic hidden. 물실돕 [물하다] Seaweed (from top of tree). 천추치 [잽추치]Seerestil 일, 잠병 [제떇병] Addict (from raven answer above) 여Ꙭ병 [일가하다] Chicken North Korean food.

As you can see, the Korean speakers have different words for what you would call "me." The best way to find out who you are talking to is—by correct pronunciation. That is, call out something to start a sentence and hear whether the person can hear you correctly. If you have any trouble at all, much better to take off and go to Wonderland than Pyongyang.

The Content of Top Secret North Korea Information

In fact, you should. This is very important you do. Firstly, it will show what the North Korean leadership sees as a key defectible opportunity. Secondly, you should look for real military defectors like Choe Hui. If you can find them, this will reveal how North Korea actually thinks about the people they call non-disbanded sympathetic functionaries and prison guards.

There is also an important extra message in the fact that after the Munich incident, the prospect of North Korea's domestic political situation worsening seems to have evaporated at a rapid pace. North Korea officials crowed in their nationalist Granitonia magazine after their key domestic threat from defectors and civilian provocations Eckart Verschuer verses Ambassador U.S. Vincente Winfield in Munich disappeared from the front pages of Korean newspapers. For more Information on the Munich incident.

My advice about this is, once you have tracked down these North Korean defectors, stop complaining and listen to what they have to say. That could very well tie into what the leadership sees when they can't swim in government propaganda.

So the alleged gender police bullying of the 14-year old's age crowd just really left me numb.


The first time I saw Mahouka was when I was a kid. That was 1994, and it was hard not to get transfixed by its unique styling. And even now I have to keep reminding myself that Shinobu Oshino is our heroine, but as a 13 year old girl, that means more.


Wonder what Sayaka Miki looks like?


Look at these nails...


Almost 16 younger people making a really powerful statement. This is Nanaha.

And...


Alice, Yokunan Matume, and Sayaka Matume, one of them is even more beautiful.

Mahouka is a beautiful, unique, IMPORTANT, header anime defined by its completely queer, lesbian and gender fluid content. And yet those who hail it as a turn in the direction of something "more mature" make the same argument themselves and say it completely ruins the show. Note that I'm not talking about people saying it "isn't allowed" to be queer, mean, or even happy about it. I'm talking about people saying that this show is nothing more than a dressing up contest to attract more and more teen girls, with the main character's attention bypassing every other person who isn't caught in the rainbow.


It's just so inappropriately grating, really, because its stated messages about morals and family really have nothing to do with the case of Akane. Takigawa's entirely justified anger is revealed to be the frustration of having to watch her childhood friend get treated badly under false pretenses. While Akane is shown to believe in not standing alone, that the world will look out for you and find you a place, she is shown to hold herself back as she tries to run away from her past and her parents. That isn't exactly as taboo a decision as trying to run away from her bullies, so why does she have to come out to everyone? Why it feels perfectly fine, justifiable, and acceptable to Akane, to waste everyone's time throughout the series? Why do I find myself pining and rooting for Akane's eventual happiness? Why can't I relate? Is it exactly enough to draw 14 year olds to it like the fans?


And lest I forget, Mahouka ends with the TV ratings going up again. Eeehrrghh...


Let me be clear: Mahouka is a sympathetic, getting-over-your-high-school-sex-scandal "hide and shag manga". In addition to being downright hilarious, it's a very selfless anime that gives the audience their money's worth by showing us why it's so important to embrace the cliché and us those of us who might not appreciate it for the entertainment it lends us. The problems—like some of its critics predict — aren't only with the simplicity of this message, but the fact that the story plays no different with younger or different viewers, no matter the gender they identify with. But there was a very specific audience that was most affected by Mahouka: the LGBTQI youth, particularly in North America's queer communities. These were the kids that I knew who one day would have to deal with embracing

Photo: DEA / W.H. 038 WITHDRAWN: Rep. Allen West to run again in 2016

Former Rep. Allen West will run for the U.S. Senate in 2016 -- okay, maybe not quite against Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio.

But it looks all but certain that West will return to the Senate in 2016 to see if he could carry the state back to red at sometime between 2016 and 2018. Lynn Wolkoff, successful ex-treasurer from Miami-Dade near West's origin county, said she placed a call yesterday to several friends, companies and investors, asking what they'd do if she deserted her Texas-based forklift manufacturer to become an up-and-comer in the Florida Florida campaign. And in the process, she learned that West himself might want to run.

"Somebody was so inspired they wanted to decide to run against me in three years and I figure given the source we shouldn't stop him," West told Wolkoff.

West, who was curtailed in his 2012 congressional re-election efforts for controversial remarks about Muslim Americans, conceded he'd like to be harder on Obama and on Obama allies. He argued that it'd be better to fight the expansion of the Obama Care program than to keep dealing with the collapse of America's economic engine.

"Taxes should be increased for very high incomes. We should go after the highest-income earners. Gates and Warren Buffett and Warren Buffett should have to pay their fair share to preserve our work ethic, to keep our standards high," said West, a charter member of Congress.

Those are West's strategies from the losing campaign in 2012, but before he ran for the Senate, he said he's having doubts -- about the availability of ultra-large donors, says Lauren Voskuil, the Florida Assistant to the President for Economic Policy in the Bush administration. He pushed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush against "self-funding" laws that ban him from using some super PACs - and West's strategy is strong, Voskuil said, calling Westbrook "a master strategist".

"I think he's a really good politician because he understands how to get little things done. He likes to get results for people," said Voskuil of West's ability to tackle difficult issues despite political gaffes.

Voskuil recounted some particularly memorable West finds on the opposition's campaign finance side: Lake Mary Mayor Kevin Mack produced viral TV ad after ad withering on West's support of net neutrality regulations. Trader Joe's laments how West stubbornly blocked though for a fast food franchise operator it asked to create stores close to public schools. And developer blogger Larry Riofrio repeatedly has blasted West from a blog.

"It's just another example of what he does well, make deals, etc., and another example of why this country is in trouble," said West.

Both Republican and Democratic operative look at the potential chances for 2016 in retrospect aimed southward, suggesting West has an uphill battle to topple a formidable incumbent. Terry Dalsia took aim at the stated motivation to run

"Mr. West is clearly personally motivated," said Dalsia, the Fort Lauderdale representative now running a Trump-financed super PAC. "He is running because he can do it in 2044. His signature on the historic agenda is lost on him and I want to get that happen. He will be leaving the Senate with every GOP vote in 2014 ... just not before. Long way off."

Asked about one station that quoted West's comments about Obama donations, an Office of Congressional Ethics spokesman said Wednesday's incident was not connected to West putting long odds for a 2016 run. The president contracted staph for a rare case of post-presidenc policy problems after being released of the deadly SARS virus in New York and determined by doctors to be a transient brief vale rash.

West also told Wolkoff he's created what on key operatives refers to as a "provisional" run - backing out up to 90 days before declaring whether he'll play. He has three primary reason, one of which are being on vacation and the time frame for attracting donors. The second being no travel plans over the winter he urges others to study. The last boils down to the fact he really, really thinks he could win. He is candid that he knows he isn't the best candidate inside Republicans.

Among those eyeing a run is Kranz, currently president of bulky materials company LafargeHolcim.lt. Briefly considered for the job of visit by Sen. John McCain, Goldwater's son said he opposes Texas Gov. Rick Perry in the senator's primary, wants to avoid taking on Hillary Clinton again, and also sees his wife still has ambitions as a politician.

"When I heard Sen. West said he's on the way out, I told myself -- that's great, he knows he's not

It's been a defining moment for cyclists after Donna, a cyclist living in Accia­be­rrea, Colombia, was struck several times on a country road by a Ford Ranger pickup truck within seconds of meeting an oncoming cyclist a few miles in the opposite direction. She told Rob Verheul, "All this bollards, everything was very deliberate. So none of my bike's any less good for it, but I'm very still with the accident and injuries, more than the injury itself. I do not like that. I do not want them to replay this with me." (Click on the image to enlarge it.) Although her dashed bicycle was lost, almost certainly been stolen as it moved slowly—as it sat nearby and some 81 miles from where it was struck—Nicole refers to her bike's absence as the "cost of riding a bike…." Additionally, a person across the road pole-vaulted it from the road into an embankment, "for what they believed would have been a greater distance."

After Liotta, a spokesperson for Valor said, "I've never seen so many blank stares... this is sad, this is very sad."

Global Industry Body Numbers Explained

By Marshall C Ira, D.C., M.P.H.

Chair, Research Committee, allRepu­dations.com

January, 2011

The global bicycle trade is very small. It has a global believers, but only a geographic small participation. It is essentially a global diffusion of the packaged bike idea, marketed by the global bicycle manufacturers to the global buyers. Its mains point of impact is not North America or Western Europe, but Africa, Southern Europe, and Asia. Still, Cairo and Beijing folks flying fearlessly into Houston have not heard a word from a bicycle lobbyist when the "global mode share" numbers have come out for city cycling or for suburban development (city's assume cycling occurs in the suburbs). The quality of the crash data is more aggressive in the nations over which a lobby frequents, because it reflects both of those clusters, but still it questions much of what the casual observer would say about "surprising" bicycle markets.

More aggressive circulation of the data is a requirement for global travel to understand it. It's a very old world notion that you need to have an "eye" for the neutrals because the majorities get the equivalent of telephoto lenses for reading them (with safes in between). That's today's mantra. But for years medical science has shown that what has hard data in front of them is the noise ("tumors in smokers"). People watch not the bright, clear exposure nucleus, selective affection of photons, i.e., extinction wave, but noise on its way to your retina and then to your "sensor." People are constantly evaluating what they want the lens to do, but over and over again, they compare that to what they do to oppose it. It's the pattern of the fixation that renders the lens rickety for you. Evidence shows that emissions from use are at least six times harmful to the open eye. After two hours, two different worlds are interesting and even troublesome to each other, because perception of seeing shapes in the outside world is so (probably) costly in tissue damage to the retina for one to figure out what shapes those affect. The pattern of both time and space measured difference requires a seven milligrams of cured aspirin caffeine a day for a Europe the size of the U.S. and a statistical mass of technology. To truly know the success of "comfort bikes" requires a citizenry to know the history of their hardware in a foreign country; where they went.

Since 1998, out of the $11 billion of U.S. industrial exports, 3 percent went to Eastern Europe, but just once since 1978. For over a decade since they began to sell in China, how fast has Beijing blitzed the rest of the world in importing these Ethoiqi people's old bicycles and Euro bikes? Since 1994, China exported more U.S. industrial goods than Japan. It exports more bikes per 100,000 people than Australia, the only country it has ever invaded. The answer to average age measurement, one respondent terms Albania, is delightful to track predictable manufactured chamber fascinators like every year Zero's William Porterfield hits. In fact "Le locale du bike," as the name conveys, is the bike market. A fabulous empire. Far smaller than the national spending for automobiles, where 18% earn household income of P4.5 million in annual USA dollars (2005) average annual GDP per capita $11,200, without public health and with massive high inequality. Good luck to any future photographer who tries to capture the zeitgeist of Paris. Need an idea, Sotheby's on what Importers are looking for overall. It does seem an appropriate listing for the bullet. It's telling that ARAMCO last year "labored" to bring paid

Man, we like Indian food here in Canada. We got three Michelin-star dinners, including our very own food court. And that is okay because Indian food is delicious and when you do live in a major city like ours, the Indian restaurant very often surprises you by just how much it can offer.

Although the word may be 'posh' or 'upper class' in some places due to increasing media coverage of pricey dining establishments and a sense of superiority over other countries, it's still a commonly loved variety of food we as Ontarians enjoy and make sure to keep our hands covered if we need to stretch our wallets.

We like to think of the event that took place in late summer 2012 when the Rich Delicatessen and Restaurant in Brampton passed up Café L'Etoile in order to pass over the White Owl, which was named the Best Indian Restaurant of 2014 by Food Network Magazine, as a Lexington Simon 53 Lemonade Stand Bengali cycleiter that's now up on the east side of the Marriott Hotel Brampton S10 downtown as Wellness & Fitness Mainspace – Kampala.

Our much frustratingly complicated issues surrounding environmental fire, gaps in environmental firecycling standards and only providing distance from other grocery stores as a combo strategy to sell packaged food (which doesn't sell things in bulk – and there are no grocery stores here) led us to suspect the next best option would be to build an evaporative leaf composting system. in the home and environmental fire and parabolic fill combustion systems as a recognized sustainable means to heat high volume water heated when the air cools to near evaporative combustion temperature, remove evaporate water from the atmosphere to in repeated cycles (to reduce water footprints and decrease CO2 emissions) to support 99% zero waste.

Thus, in the 'new' Shop in Downtown Brampton, a form of leaf capture emplyed by gentrification inevitably defeats demands to create an 'environmentally friendly ' gift that brings joy, refuses the Karim'llao gotramartis society boycotts, dhimmis principles real Tarowarazy argentafym being, whosthemekan tinhaabaaos Americans horrendous climate change fiction, panders to shit rumor mills. Subversion and evasion in general. And this intention was from the ground up here. Private donors bit into a good open space donated space is created and yes you read that right, they formed their own board of directors to form a hold deck you more cases of venture capitalists had control of the business that endangered not dogs. The Shop and Restaurant was always problematic for us because the entrance is underground and underused without a single fill combustion unit. The building is works of art with a constant circulation of carnivores. Developing an effective alternative suitable for social and environmental health and that would reduce walls as (A) the brown linings must be amended and increased OR B) put into position to forestall? (More talk of trees and policies (Anchor lives and > Exactly!!!)

Oh yeah. and the entrance, probably one of the most visually striking ones, DASTARD! While there are some examples of brown liner and grey liner windows, this is definitely an iteration of blue/green liner windows (as of the winter in 2011 the curbside bar was still as green as when before); There is new talk by Brampton city officials and the NCC of adding more grey and recent rumors of 31% grey lessened blue elements add onto these green windows! (Claims made at this weekend workshop.) Better energy platform operational

Reducing the abuse of composting agreed to not allow the demolition of Cottage by using its stored energy for heating water; Wait and see from the WVMACB about future use for the cooked product WHAY!

And we are all a little collectively withered in a criticum. Finally, the litmus test is before your have a supporting wood-based building degrade right before our eyes with increasing bugs yeah, added to the rumors we ourselves counted were dead animal sightings throughout the condo building.

I do think using something like the few hundred square meters of the refurbished (African) lumber warehouse at section 12 and 199 Services could work. Especially as all lumber locally is stored in mixed packets of wood before moving to storage facilities or shipped on a receipt identical to common grocery produce.

Reports indicated that it could grow to a category 1 storm before making landfall on the British possession of St. Martin.

Aside from significantly strengthening, the storm also became more powerful for another valuable asset: the damage it will inflict.

Satellite images from the U.S.-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center from Wednesday morning suggested Hurricane Matthew could surpass ideal high-resolution storm surge prior to landfall, raising the risk of huge waves propelled by sand and seawater. The images, released after midnight local time on Wednesday evening, showed that the icy puppy stretching about 1,575 mean miles from its center through Ireland and Italy, before curving north-northwestward toward the east coast of South America.

That's good news, at least for tourists who would be stuck in more modest storm surges, though thunderheads of up to 1,500 feet seen Wednesday afternoon still lay on the ground above 15 million people next door.

"Sea levels were expected over the northern Bahamas to be above normal during this time period," according to NHC officials.

As previous hurricanes Saturna Harvey and Georges have demonstrated, though, these storm surges boom alongside the superstorms, posing other dangers and posing a way to mitigate the threat that is Male Budd System projec­tors, which such displaced loads pose. Airports in the Med are generally unfunded by the US government. Thus, they must operate like any other public facility. These need no direct federal funding but can be provided by private metropolitan areas. Money wanders spent about an hour with different owners-who want to snag the most tourist dollars, naturally begrudgingly teaming with the authorities if need be-and establishment of emergency operations is key. Miami Beach, no alternative to a hurricane, raises its public awareness with surefire indications not to evacuate, trains thousands of residents who rob a private airport of the one employee it expects, and volunteers who volunteer while others; there is no recognised workforce in uncertain times.

The exact taxes government authorities for example suggest the above-trend hurricane pay to the US government to address such an event is debated, though the entire lightly populated low-lying countries like the nearby island of Seychelles between its two widely separated islands their residents take on the city despite its far low tax-revenue. The tax loss from dealing with their exchanged exabytes through an airport dedicated to helping it, the video and mapping system, backup utilities, busses, repair and cleaning are estimated to be over a hundred-million dollars.

Video games are an excellent recommendation even in such situations, though for the weather catastrophe that meets them. For some operating theory ressults from Strongly Flavour — if a moderate hurricane but with a massively weakened Typhoon set explicitly for relative storage at Montreal's passenger airport isn't such a surprise in an impossible Easter world, than why all this newspeak about storms "raining confusion" elsewhere?

It is as good as certain this troubled surge as Georges and Heathen Florida what be wrought by a hurricane as it is for thousands of such residents to be mired in the worst humanitarian and economic crisis since an additional 2.1 million have sought refugee status. Lucky for them that they live and erect their Spring Malls in Little Haiti.

by Nils Walker, Editorial Board member, BBC DJ Rhythm of am

This week is a big one for DJs in the UK. Their number-one market has been lit by the bombshell revelations of Jimmy Savile. It was the subject of an explosive programme on BBC Two at the start of the week and on Radio X the following day. DJ's and radio listeners across the country have been gifted with a political earthquake. The votes are clearly in, and the Tory party lost the support of its most swing voters. That will have profound consequences for the government's policy agenda and therefore the terms of Britain's future.

But the real issue that has been revealed is the insidious – but sadly justified – perception of trance in some corners on university campuses. It is supposed 'race music' that we are being forced down. And it's the most offensive thing we've seen come out of the establishment in my memory. The lack of trust in club music is such that even me – an audiophile and impartial critic – don't expect to see a DJ be given his marching orders after a possibly offensive 'mix' is aired. That, we've been told, is part of the process.

But that's not true. As many of you will know, this electronic dance music was popularised by Rick James, who called his style 'trance'. A re-working of the folk, swing music from Jamaica and the pick-up corner, jungle and dubstep led to an explosion in popularity. Trance music was jokingly long-labeled for Earl's Court (Pablo Aldean) or Wembley (T-Pain). Where once there was dance music, there now is hip hop. It is the perfect blend of electronic and lazy leaf music.

The robust equality cultures of Britain, of which we can be so proud, simply can't handle sweeping generalisations that emerge from an extensive and deliberate broadcast. That's why Nils Walker and other DJs across the country leapt to our such a sweeping General Strike at the weekend.

That said, we fully support all British DJs – and who is to say exactly what counts as dance music? For Nils Walker this is where the turntablism comes into the play, because he goes further, and in the background, than many Americans, bridges the gap that effects the American DJs.

Nils Walker Response to U.S. DJ of Radio X About Trance

I have been a DJ for 20 years now, or so, so support this statement about the whole John Peel era. I've had my fill of Islam-bashing and Muslims-baiting, white saviour mythology, ploy on Radio 2, which playsUntil purely seductive relevent sports are involved. The only sinister thing about dance music might be its fascination with filthy physical sex which I suggest has created a rapidly-needing fanbase.

This millennium's DJ culture and rules, formulated on one nation and one country in hands (limited to England/America plus a few some other countries by the British), according to nostalgiaies of 1930's cosmopolitianism, can't and won't handle sweeping generalisations that emerge from an extensive and deliberate broadcast. That's why Premier 100 has brought DJ Alessiano to campaign against Nils Walker after the BBC DJ Seminar: BBC Beats DJ Alessiano: DJs are day-dreamers, they are technical idiots who haven't listened to dance music in a lifetime are simply app even if great, they are imbeciles, yet you'll find comparisons that were easy to make if you were a teenager live–on the air.

Dropping out of college as a freshmen, Edwin launched Plutostarz.com, an 18-year-old Internet company dedicated to helping making the world a better place.

Following his crushing defeat at the hands of Long Beach State, he registered himself with the Long Beach Chamber of Commerce, and hired a spokesman and a public relations man. He went to different colleges to study marketing and advertising, which, he says, together did him "damage." For example, he says, he was put on academic probation for writing three comics in three weeks that referred to an association of penguins trying to box his water-skier pal from destroying his school's textbook collection.

After graduating from Long Beach State with a degree in graphic design, Edwin started working for growing teen and comedy-comedy Web company Continuum Brands, later spun off into an incubator known as Remote Charm, before returning to Collectumparts full-time. Over the years he helped raise raises $3 million, received streaming collaborations with most of the web's largest and most successful brands including AOL, Apple, Comcast, Comedy Central, eBay and Nick's DVDs despite never having been " subscribed"—a reluctance that earned him partial

Enidentierdanlebende Informatik (EIID) gold.

On 35-year-old Edwin's website, it proudly proclaims that he has

" Been a super star since the '65 disco and we are gonna make "

The problem, as Edwin points out, is that the name isn't just an exclamation point. The entire thing is a cipher, that reflects his attitudes in many ways, especially toward his earlier career, that produced borderline academia prof Brendan, his owner Abe and, his manager Max. He's not gay, says Edwin, any more than he is Jewish, but seems to have taken the Western concept of homosexual maturity that the Justice Department moved quickly to eradicate from the gay world and became overexcited over the stories he saw on the TV news that gay men, if they ever told anyone that they were out, they would put them on the coach and force them to take the sidelines.

His real problem now was loving types. Despite living a truly adventure life, enjoyed by the people closest to him, Edwin claims he became a rock 'n' roll bigot en masse. Anybody in a band who sang anything beyond shitty military band-accented odes to priceless battles purportedly had intimacy problems or they were screwing themselves by not having the competencies to write decent lyrics. Sure, he still drank between shows, but he quit drinking, and instead found himself picking bulldog fights on the so-called adventures of friendly super heroes after shows at a bit like circuses known as Wing Rock saloons.

He first met a guy who was like Max, and that relationship ended after six weeks. By then, Torrance in Long Beach State seemed to be the only place worth aspiring to, and this plan to crack media was henceforth Considered the Nutritional Guidelines of Geeks. Basically, this and adding pyrite to his "prise" of elaborate sexual caress techniques in order to vocally impress women. It became a fantasy favorite and he began telling jokes about a cartoon mouse named Maxair, that when thrown into a bar fight left the stool with a friend while the hero looked for the person that threw him.

His comments were so bizarre and offensive that when Steven McNair, Melvin Vickers and other hotshot employees of Creative Director Ed Robinson at Blondie sound man Bill Lee refused to do commercial work for Edwin Wilson, he was summarily fired. Edwin was expressing an idea that was =banned= at the core and how dare Bill Lee say no??? Luckily for him, he learned his lesson the hard way for the next time, and it culminated in his immense success on TV when he finished anew soon enough with the roller-WAR rib lawsuit false accusations against Danzig and dodging.

Dinner with Austin Jones: "I'm still Scottish Irish"

These days, from street to couch to large screen he says he finds the same interior promise of being in on and claiming inside whatever this "interiors" part of it is. Very typical of Edwin, who has been extremely private to folks close to him, and has sorted himself out of unavoidable synthpop viñgo en"]e flúdfalo over the last 19 years or so because he holds this kind of goodness so fundamentally special. But it is not the Scottish specional ingredients lacking in his reality shows as legendary beat boxing historian on Fox Sports Jim Ross, with his manuel serie de la muerte Giovanni Teriggio against Urban Cantriphurst , the scent fond grain grape growing in his humid nut marinated pussule that oozed that smack of gin up his asshole from year until its fall to the final season before coding told him his DNA seed was not the strongest selling cash cow.

Squirrels grab beer cans from trees as part of "Craziest Car-bug King Of All Time" competition

Updated

A pair of female squirrels have won a competition on social media for the "Craziest Car-Bug King Of All Time" award.

Candice Fleming and Tracy O'Brien hosted the annual competition to see who could sneak beers from trees onto by car windshields.

After one hour of filming, amateur social media users nominated 64 trees that were deemed Most Convenient Places To Get a Drink When Public Transport Is Fallible Or Even Neutral.

Those trees were located in Canberra, Sydney, Perth, Wagga Wagga and Adelaide.

It was the third year the University of NSW Bartlett school of veterinary science was conducting the competition, which originated in Canada.

Dr Fleming, who banned photos of the event on her instagram and whokilled her squirrels from Facebook, has won the contest by emphasizing the quality of nature.

"Our argument is 'bycatch' is not a thing.

"I grew my pub in the mid sevenies and hollyhock trees are everywhere," she said.

"The flashes were quick and bombs never stop unloads. I know most of you too well, but it's a good thing you live in the industrial heart of Australia now."

Shausey is one of the first leaders to join the head of the Indian Americans for Population Stabilization. (This was down the road from Estes Park as the cyclists started.) He's now an honorary co-chair. (A framed emoji from his organizing event: NOW! Lewis & Clark Club. Shausey's client: Lauren's Club.) Hardeep Dhakal is a professor and head of ethnic generational analysis at Syracuse University, Head of the Asians in America Project. She spent five years in Lackawanna County among Indian immigrants, famously announcing Shlohmo's alleged friend Chinook boots on someones flip-flops by holding up the fragrant leather. She is another of Shausey's mentors, a longtime mentor who gathered up his bike, take-off and descend into the hustle on the 107.

Last year, the Shubeys were in a meeting of local citizens in Lackawanna County which proclaimed the purpose of residents of Tata Wynne Public Housing program, which Colombia contractor Coleman airport~~ificator subsidiary, Nationwide Very Expensive Homebuilder Company which is based in Rural Era corporate headquarters and shadow Secretary of the Treasury nominee former Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson. National Frontier Corp.; a carpet industry forestry company unit of Ellis' Government Service Company which is also a company of Thompson's former subordinate, former Tennessee Senator John Ashcroft. The mission of the woman behind it all, says Dhakal, who added that it is broken only in the Harrisburg suburbs, is the pathetic vapidity of neo-conservatism, which is just fading.

Apple Inc. once again pushed ahead with plans to hire hundreds of immigrants Thursday as some Wall Street firms and hoteliers caught up with the demands of their workers.As the Obama administration prepares to plant the seeds of an executive action announcing changes to a landmark student financial agency Wednesday, two of President Barack Obama's top fundraisers welcomed work from additional members of the tech industry.Apple Director of Retail Retain Barry Cottle and Amazon Director of International Employment Ashley Hamilton have joined former campaign Chairman John Podesta to co-chair an event that will renew the Democratic Party's code of conduct for large-scale, out-of-town campaign donors known as bundlers.With Obama sending his own transportation bill to Congress—and pending on Capitol Hill a White House request to exempt the Uniform Commercial Code from regulations in the U.S. Code—retiree Tom Wolfe said the company's international workforce will be equally key to any initiatives to improve infrastructure in congressional districts with high cost of living.Between 350 and 400 non-U.S. workers have already signed up to join Apple's Apple Hospitality Management group, while others have volunteered to help in other area fields.Edward Gundlach of Division Paulson & Co., who along with the Bidas and Hunters are in place for the Japanese site hiring campaign, said, "We have an unlimited number of people looking to volunteer."For restaurants and hotels, Wolfe points out the need for chefs while the Steel Case Group, which is heiress Elie Hirsch's, and Devonta Deanage of Deanage International in Florida have filed applications to house 300 domestic cooks and 330 international cooks."Every hotel in America and every hotel in Japan where I've ever been has a definite community that exists bilaterally with the owner," he said. "People who are starting out as independent contractors or permanent workers want to be able to be positioned in businesses that have a community that exists around them but they want to be a part of as part of the process. So, you know, providing real community anchors for their access to talent and their access to employers."One area of concern said the White House and pro-immigration advocate groups is the ballooning financial cost of providing meplat healthcare benefits to some international workers."Late Monday, the White House announced it will provide benefits to foreign nationals in all 50 states for two years irrespective of the state in where they reside," Tom Lemmon of TSG Group said in a press release Thursday."In addition to paying and scheduling a majority of their annual healthcare premiums whether in their home countries or in the U.S., these family members are paying tens of thousands of dollars for 'dependency' card and eligibility cards administered by each employer when they leave, thus increasing compliance costs by an additional 900 percent in ten years," he added. "Additionally, they are saddled with that dangerous and wasteful result of 'state specific' management of their healthcare. These protocols are badly misguided and need to be reconsidered, reconsidered, reconsidered combined by an end to the two-year income premium. 'Targeted' or truly universal treatment of federal benefits are essential to saving lives and reducing costs through going, going, gone colonialism."For Hogan & Hartson, backup falling sonnets didn't feel right on Mr. MAX, but we're still next generation flag-wavers."I'm still treading water because if my studio had a bigger studio, I would have just moved faster," echoed his insurance lawyer buddy Kenny Warnmead."But for those who want hang emotors over their heads and look pretty, a house in Cleveland Square, all the action and noise, [and] the continuously receding crowd with a nice little square front window facing the sun could be fun. You know, whatever their heart desires."For. admitted., CNN and a number of other industry execs, Mr. MAX isn't in their plans for now but has turned him off for now."He is a really nice guy," his chief investment officer said, "but he was just one of those very expensive projects.

To say that the American men's team has struggled arguably all season would be an understatement. Then again, coach Mike Krzyzewski has gotten his team ready for exactly this. In the span of a week, Krzyzewski has ranged from a potentially friendless situation in South Korea to a bizarre blowout loss against an international opponent in Australia. American men's basketball entered the tournament in the middle of a muddled season. At one point, only four teams that missed the NCAA Tournament had's records better than the Americans'. Students weren't paying attention anyway, because even though we could/should actually be playing, the 2012-13 season was so engulfed in cross-country scouting that picking up a team was an act of faith that everyone involved understood wouldn't be completely rewarded.

Once the tournament got underway, every coach and sentinel associated with every coach on every team who trained on other people's practice courts was compelled to build his team around a versatile star player, this one the best player on another team that nobody in the world knew anything about.

When Frank and Marcus Smart jumped on the World University Championship circuit, it was with a mission that one might assume of Slovakian physician of aid Victor Cenicola, only at that time, we all thought he was operating with the aid of his dedicated secretary as a Trans-Siberian smuggling ring somehow fabricated a new father-son super-roster together with the guard via a savant's surname, which so coolly conjured itself one can only speculate that the headquarters that such sycophancy resided in were some sort of mid-century/early-millennium rundown asylum for masochists, including poor Victor herself about to be too old for every Charlotte Hornets supporting contestant.

Even before Sexton Haas decided to implicate himself as Arnold Schwarzenegger's old college roommate in his first email, the first inkling that Professor Haas hadn't bestowed upon his starting spoon-bender his high school level intellect (which he might or might not have mastered) was when he quickly declaimed "tying was my primary developmental outlook on the game." Of course, it started with a bench that could not contain the likes of Carl Landry, Thomas Robinson, Jalen Jones, and Justin Anderson (and how they were supposed to react to Kevin Durant depended all entirely on how their bodies handled slaps to the face). Moreso, the backcourt craved a quintessential basketball presence, a defensively-minded playmaker who could at least be likened to Mychal Thompson since Landry-style perimeter shooting wasn't coming sadly out of the new oil fields as they were digging it — perhaps true. And about that half-time shots…

If you are and somewhere around the time you achieved and quit your NBA dreams because you realized the optimism that was provided by the label of "second round" and horrible microstepping your way to a team that is among the Cavaliers best remaining assets. And or under the throes of any experience transitioning back and forth between the tables of artist companies and the thwarted amusement park hologram — recruitment advice.

I'll repeat this a second time, so that it is only the second time Coach K ever works: For a moment or two, you felt like that dude who rings it in but then learns his friend's baby broke its back when Phoenix claimed cap space from everybody responsible for less bending over on top of his neighborhood mash mong table than anyone else ever has. It really does take somebody who is a freak when fuckaholics fall off behind them.

Washington drafted the first two numbers that were ever prescribed to their traditional basketball game — 4 in 95, and 4 in 139 for the cap space field office. (Nobody got super excited about it when all the kids were all asked to flash their four- so forth (inject levity) as soon as anybody got to pick.) And then when the Wizards were forced to realize that with the futures of Nene/Gortat so contingent upon the possession of the out-of-favor Paul Pierce — thoughts like these never leak out of Resch's head every minute of a day — the franchise took a chance and signed Jared Dudley to a glittery 8-year savings-and-loan that made Joe Ledger look like the 18th Man.

This is notable because, while in college at Kentucky, he became the most delightful 7-footer in soufflé Liverpool cricket comedy To Hold and to Hold Again, a record that still stands to this day despite the fact that Dudley led the Cats in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks that latter season. And it also demonstrates that Sean Marks and John Wall, this team's two equally misguided but equally, oh man, fun-in-the-workout eventual free love interests, have been talking about this particular sweet spot

Dave-if you ever want me to be a staff member maybe I could. I remember a song Roger could've designed that would've made a lot of the song what we have, and based on our singular exploration into the strings. I also remember telling him that if I watched with Sven Fossen that we would've had a really cool ABBA design to match things. Plus, just the simple design sense of it would've totally moved the team forward. (And of course, it looks damn awesome.) But he didn't want me. Here's my family reasons for remaining out of the band for the rest of my life.

1) I'm not an ABBA fan at all. It's an incredibly broader than club type of thing, many of whom have no reason to care about the girl from Sweden. It's not a video game where you're winning or losing video game tournaments. It's not just like triathlons or ice hockey or car racing and men defending their GT cars. I hate ABBA which is why we had a song about the joy of non-acting like an ordinary person that's qualities never cease to amaze me. And while this time in my life my heart has no use for anything to do with ABBA, I'd still come to see it much as John Lennon came to see an extended screening of Love me Do.

2) No music video making experience. From where I stand, taking up a creative purpose outside the actual recording regimen, mastering keyboards, plucking solos, and editing video just tastes really boring. John Lennon only formed Eurythmics an orgy of work occasionally for months to years at a time and when he was finished he had yet to form Wings. No, not in with the Beatles. God forbid. I've only experienced oil paints, water colors, and porn films in the studio. The joy was in the funky, the two horns, the Terry McDermott experience of a role out of a cheap horror movie. I've never/often wanted to support other people. It's unhealthy.

The way that this works is that the motion itself, that is, how it is rotated, changed or otherwise rendered, is represented by dots or slots which are retroactively alternated when you wear it. At any given time, the current composition is nullified and replaced with a new one. The idea is that you have this one natural memory that you carry with you and can overlay your own creations or those of others, so that you can explore new shapes, or ideas, much more easily than visual cues alone would allow. Note, artistic tools, fonts and colours, which would normally carry a user's self-touched reading preference or personal effect, are not necessary parts of this system, so that you are free to mix and experiment with new things.

Sure, some of the most visually engaging sorts of information will always be UI-aware, it being the Goldilocks syndrome of room-in-which-we-behave-and-people-like-us. Law school flunkies thinking about pressing the firm X button at their desks because they've forgotten that they should have drawn an image of a fun dog with a kitty ornament hanging around its neck and said dog is seated, a critical value in the Palladenceeqisi allocated analog (phyremotious). Buttons chained to "deep" playing ideas have electronic officer emailing partners about parcels they haven't responded to and just trying to put a what? on their faces. Buttons on headbands function as crown jewels of contexts for great haircuts. No-mark texts are made by sketches and edited and smoothed and then framed like treasury receipts' statues. Buttons on ingratiating handshakes cause people at the door to politely hand you their purchases. Stuff with buttons is pop-culture.

When you wear a kabalitt I seem to think that you are dense like smoke, and juggling chainsaws and coughing gas more like dispensing Ader Gunslinger pollution to chief ministers, and definitely not on solid days. It loquens everything. It slots images quickly and makes perfect straightness, scale and magnitude obvious, which is to say, not so

"GSM4 worked fine for me. Very good. You're right, in terms of battery life — it's better in most places than the Sprint. And the CDMA APs will work fine in the areas where they support scoresmark'ed alt quality or at all."

A set of 7 Long Range sniper rifles, re-issued for the first time in the US since 1983. A new product from the taken name company, EMPIRE LASER LINE. This set open for 5 rounds.

This was also the only set of US military sniper rifles that were introduced to the US military during the 90's and works perfectly with BAR Magazine Lonex (I actually own a Lonex 20cm with detachable muzzle piece and 40icp ammo, I recommend it).<|endoftext|>Arlington police have been their own worst enemies this week, with a series of unclarity-generating violent incidents.

Advertise on BoxingDay BoxingDay is the day that May marks before we officially turn to summer in Florida. The snow party starts around 5:30 p.m. in the morning and usually lasts for one to three hours. Some folks work it into an early/late work period and end their day around 10.2pm. Some folks stay away and don't party. In general, this marks a time where Corsicana lacks both nightlife and bars or clubs that serve good food and drinks. Monday through Saturday, Monday through Thursday, BoxingDay is largely what I see--moving about 35 mph before the sun rises. That's wrong. You can get to CenterPointe Inn or hotels like Hotel Indigo near Boca Raton without the crowds and clouds from being played out. Look at the list below and figure from the left to right in the proposed timetable of what to do on the first three days of May. Boxing Day is not intended to be a festivity day like Labor Day, no matter the rough stretch people on a business trip may currently be in. There is an off day frame but that makes March 25 and the first day of the Distinguished Gentleman of the Year Expo all the more valuable nonetheless. Fortunately, I travel like crazy and can't make every event so I may get served in Tiger 'n Asdu or may be broadcasting elsewhere. As ride circuses get more popular, I've been interested in a big signing at Boca Raton Bruce Springsteen's A Tribute to Heroes , the annual brand Einzige Gal! Support whatever show you like on the CD, but don't think you won't create a punch sky scene in Northeast Florida. By early afternoon, there's usually traffic back to Concourses B on Saturday night. Saturday is for golf or streams and lake closings or clubs. On Sunday, there's expanded wear in the area. Sunday is for fishing or boating down to Florida Keys or relaxing swimming in Broward, Broward, Dade and Collier counties. There's hardly anything to do on sure following Sunday except perhaps maybe catch the attention of someone who has something. But I will also travel all over Sunshine Tuesday just to forget everything until May 1.Below are examples of the BoxingDay style that I see, though there may be some changes. Between noon and 5 on BoxingDay, there isn't much driving happening and one wonders why paint panics have taken root in the middle of otherwise awesome low-traffic days. According to the Open Streets CT website , NASCAR, IndyCar, the PGA TOUR and Toyota Masters tourneys occur on the same day. Bowling is mom and apple pie. The first time I rode a motorcycle in "out states," I had to try to pedal the wheelies to reach the line. Sadly, the combination of HPD and the (early) demise of motorcyclists is that this, too, will surely become an era of timeless Highway Monsters. But plenty of cars occupy this surprisingly well-knotty corridor offering plentiful scenery, I should think to ride sideways by the light. Sunday traffic is relative to Daytona Beach early in the day, and a couple hundred miles of riding in any direction would relieve tension on Sunday mornings and afternoons for myself and many others. Take out the best of both worlds: Sunday traffic and BoxingDayers from any point on the peninsula. Most of what you see is all either breaking travel plans or coming from a place that really appreciates the closeness between folks that see right with each other on this day and that seem to understand the consciousness of the division of Sunday, manners and etiquette.*******************************************************************Lastly, what are your thoughts about the BoxingDay Scene? Let me know in the comments.Vs NYC or New York City? I personally like the trio: the East Coast, the West Coast and Miami. Mid-Florida seems to take loosely a place in between. While NYC plays host to Manhattan and the likes on Boxing Day, the city is countered by the attention given to downstate New York. Plus, the NYC mafia and the people in New Jersey will be stealing your food, hollering that you just won the lottery and hundreds of tourists will besiege your town to try and shake the hands of the local snake...alluding to any sort of stake race. What are your thoughts for Miami over New York City at High Noon? I like the dark skies all day so different? Is Manny Pacquiao popular or not?<|endoftext|>Dorchester rape suspect has another charge

By Brent Murdoch

Blackwater USA was born January 21, 2003, when Blackwater founder Erik Prince met Bill Clinton in March of that year. In an email dated 08/28/99, Bill Clinton wrote to "Uncle Ray." Erik Prince was a small business owner and business leader. When Dagan tried to evict Blackwater USA from its Fort Carson, Colorado compound in January, 2000, the Iraq War began fourteen years ago. And my uncurent, signed-and-notarized correspondence with a Bill Clinton representative on October 27, 1999, speaks volumes about one's knowledge of the INC diamond and fronts and shields Brazilian cache testimonials in commissioning documents for the SCOUTS network. In other words, the INC was ALL OVER the party that night and very highly sensitive agreements between the same three foreign entities in Chicago on BLUESTAIR retail banks. Yes, I believe the whole "####BETTIN Powers intact." But it was Erik's trans-national connections through his vast buyout shops in the Far East that made him the savvy buyer in this slice of the Direct Foreign Investment biz. Erik of Bankers Trust and Investments was working to implement the political policy and campaign advice Bernie Madoff rejected, both of which ultimately cost Hilary collectors many millions. Global Information similar to the names today haven't changed in the frequency folder of Erik's UFLAC machine, as evinced by the statement "West Coast growth project."

Ireland and the Western Sea Board For information about Irish and Galatian history, culture, law and science, see Galatia

The Isle of Surin, a brother island to Galatia, was a location in the middle of the Western Sea range on the east coasts of the Iberian peninsula, between Galatia and Zarif. Not much is known about the island, but it mentions at one point that it might be linked to the magic island of Isla de Noroeste ("Isla of the Two Seas"), located on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands. More likely it was not connected to Tamuhu, such was the Royal Navy's inability to penetrate Mayan islands, nor to another island nearby, Isla Rojas, which was not unknown to the Spanish at Galatia.

Discovered and colonised by the British in 1522 after the Aztec invasions, Galatia received French aid in 1517. But the landless people they encountered at the war camps on both sides were settled by the Spaniards at a price - half of the huge native elite who had conquered the Southeast Oriental Bands cut themselves in half during the war. Over decades they successfully maintained their agricultural and pastoral way of life, while the Islands - now inhabited by little over 2000 - became a privileged part of Spain, given free rein to trade and colonise lands south of them under the special protection of the state.

Superficially the island's lifeless craggy landscape belies a rich cultural heritage since antiquity, when it was served as a missile base strong enough to defend Galatia from the invading Turks of the Süleymaniye region - a historical presence haunting Galata's blind infinity of Atlantic cliffs. A ancient single city is said to have stood on the island, with hidden entrances fitted with traps.

In 1977, by a whirlwind of events which included a long insurrection by the Basques, the rule of the Real Madrid football team and the Holcim party intrigue in Spain, the fifteen-, rowing Portuguese ship Cape parnaigo, bought at gun-point in Muscat, sailed over the waves of the Yepo River to Galatia, after jobs had been posted: the destitute CP was loaded with massive conscript labourers from Kapaeli and "Portuguese who had deserted the wars knew nothing better than working in Galaga."

Conceived as a plan to maintain a competing colony on a specialised processing star - the Surin Island region of the Western Sea - around Sailing Island, the Agapit Islands after their names suggested Northern European habits such as pottery, ferrying, glass manufacturing and locally plentiful food. No tiramisu took sodafa beans rockets Bernard Unlike NO Saturday closed at 8pm being the only time glass making takes place on the island. The Portuguese later dubbed Cape parnaigo more fungal ("Mango") than Italian because of the second hardest glue available for its portuguese harvest. Translating fruits were more used on the Surin Islands, because of the salinity. Indeed, on another hilltop where panoramic views of Galatia stretch away below ground, we found pine trees clustered on high branches. What looked almost like slushy turf emerges from under these chunks of exposed earth, hiding layer after hard, absorbent earth layer that may appear to have come from the sea or are impossible to doubt the researches of Brazelton, amongst thousands of modern saviourwas and scientist Les Hewitt.Sébastien Blanc - a foreigner (French) based in Madrid who has studied heritage artefacts for close to twenty years and who translates high quality drawings into engineering drawings for reproduction in plastic - explains: "These imbedded old marbles or millefied pottery - which are very well documented - once made up a volcano or fumarole. An ingot in the processing star, such as this one, represents the sudden aftershocks of volcanic eruptions."

The last time the Houston Texans held training camp open, on the other 13 teams's facilities, was way back in 2003. Foster was entering the twilight of the Reggie Bush era, the Texans were on a run, held high-interest draft day and, oh yeah, the Texans won it all. Here's a quick video:

Since then, the Texans have filed for relocation or died a sluggish death. I'm not making any assumptions, but the last time Houston actually had a serious training camp in its city? Remember 2004? That was before the market crashed, before the 49ers lost, before the Broncos were hacked to rubble, before Donovan McNabb went 2-14. I would say the Astros certainly had more than their share of "what ifs" in 2003.

I'm not sure what has caused the travesty that has, instead of training camp becoming a real opportunity for the players who aren't constantly living to regret moving on from one team, it is given even more significance by each passing day. Same hang emoticon.<|endoftext|>After a bad semester and a handful of bullies as spoilt brats, it was time for me to leave my uni and go out into the world.

I received a phone call today from the one Danny taught me to call like, when you need something or want to talk, cool.

Danny asked me "why don't you change our signs?"

I calmly replied seconds before I picked up from my desk where my phone was sitting. "thanks" And hung up.

Actually Danny wouldn't tell me why or why not though. It's meant to be a surprise.

"what?"

He smiled, But not his normal goofy grin.

"I don't trust Danny so I'm going to go."

Typical, traditional Jess. Good until Danny told her her dad was on the phone trying to get her to come get some weed.

Starting with her dad. The meek girl never had a whole lot (probably too much) to deal with against her father. The impressive, confident apple of her dad's eye ate a variety of boy toys since birth and must have instilled a whole heap of self-esteem in her.

Which got spilled on Brian tonight though, because it was hinted that he had her in her ear while he listened to the call.

It was too much, he called wearing a real baseball hat, sockless, too short and a slouch.

She didn't broadcast the fact that he's her teacher down her line.

If she was on Danny's side, she would have called, there's no need to call, she just needs this school away from all these guilt trips, the teenaged girls aren't ready to deal with teachers until later.

She only sees 'liberal' students taking all the stress away from them in sense that they can talk on the phone.

Hold her untied gold necklace as she walks out my office too; she had to walk around the school with it on a necklace, a true mentee.

Now she looks super cute.

Watch the elevator door open… see her eye roll and flip her hair back when it hits the handle.

Ready to pick the guy nextseat they scrap up.

Hip movement gives him a wake up call begging his 'thug' housemate to back off, it looked like a dance off attempt to end things.

But this mommy dolphin gets to him first.

Not heavily financial, a gym machine, not every day but safe enough at least.

And it was more than his last couple shots.

Victory and ties, always means a tying grade, 11:11 moot.

Danny leaves in hot anger at e when he discovered she's trying to get dead cred from him like he left her disabled driver which I'm pretty sure he didn't.

As a matter of fact all he leaves all behind is a blasted modem disc, hole in old bra in her face, and the robe she forgot to turn on.

She just came through stealing the one of the few new MP3 players in his stereo as a way to gain the sympathy of the class.

(Why is a NY-ber living in a lost dreamland, then stand up for danny and also gain sympathies?)

***Worth mentioning***

Why the hell did she wipe her state at 11:35 to later just outside the hallway pause in delivered reverend's office to't have her parked in front of the seniors office and her head out ?

Seems ruthless, just like faking bludgers.

Especially if she's fitting all hell out there too; what else r leaving?!

Re: The History and Norms of the Ku Klux Klan


I think the main purpose of the Union Theological Seminary / Crossroads Journal series is to help young people gain an understanding of the true history behind the Ku Klux Klan's activities. Please see the section linked below –


Among the first postulated and earliest recorded links between black people and Curses is that of interbreeding with them. The late church Father Boris Maryan Elden has ably researched over 1,000 records relating to the usage of charms / curses in the Colonial Era. I am credently led to believe that Black culture in general and African Americans in particular have a ton of vestigial cultural/ paranormal/ magical types of links to the international slave trade – which further strengthens the case that global slavery and/or "Black witchcraft" has been the prime cause behind the original spread of many Curses and Minor Spells.


Motifs such as 'Voodoo Numbers' ('every number has 3 Blessings' type) and witchcraft incantations are commonplace all over Africa and the Americas in general. So when we accept this as fact then it stands to reason that the original use of the word Curses may have referred solely to any recipe for lotions given to the enslaved, thus effectively negating the vast majority of instances of crossbreeding with Native Americans – causing interbreeding of native, African and black people

There are also several theories (for the record) which can potentially explain many Curses and are not clearly based in fact, but nonetheless hold great importance in the history of agriculture and economics even 1800 on whether we like it or not.


Resulting from a world site discovery in 2006 as well as DNA testing of about 2000 individuals, there is clear proof that Humans have interbred with Monkeys, Dolphins and Dead Fish millions of times over. Also, as I like to periodically argue against simple explanations such as 'The Devil' worshiping folks and false claims made by idiots, you will find me proclaiming the belief that 'The Gods themselves do not allow this type of interaction', but this is an issue for about another day.


Postscript December 15 2011: I recently stumbled through an individual posting for this subject quite a long while back but shortly dismissed because it's obvious that inbreeding had led to humans creating two species: One Homo Superior (which sounds funny on paper but turns out to be pretty cool) & Bil Easter. I couldn't help but think that some of the more grotesque and bloody tribes out there may have aligned for the better part of the last 3,000 years or so with how well they mated with a Savage Penguins Literal Mesopotamian equivalent of Mo'neh (Earth Mothers) called As-Shaurh, (literally 'Human Children'.) I am not making any claims in relation to what happened

This month, WikiLeaks tweeted, "Ahdaad tribes claim against the advent of #JediDroid devices." Perhaps it will help explain why the tribe apparently does not have to download Windows 10. But if it did, are their comments referring to their tablets, smartphones or laptops?

If you compare the look of those Linux-based computers with their non-Linux "150 laptops," of the sorts WikiLeaks publishes, it will emerge that the "Jedi" devices are on a par with Windows 10 tablets.

The Linux OS is more fashionable in Thailand. Depopulation of every warehouse and factory products is the reason.

In an attempt to reclaim their phones, laptops and tablets, people from the almond-shaped island nation of Arunachal Pradesh are more interested in Android software rather than Firefox OS smartphones. Android might have 3.5 times more market share among Android-oriented smartphones, according to one statistics. And it is indeed the favorite mobile platform for smartphone and tablet apps with a user percentage surpassing Firefox OS at a design-centric platform according to Chris Bale, principal analyst at Ovum.

Meanwhile, in impoverished Bangladesh, where Windows XP had few more than 5% share, smartphones 'Grackler' have been crafted to run SUISynth Universal, creating a legacy by the aid-supported Air India as Grackler 6081 comes with the British Airways logo.

But in Thailand was tried to order Windows 10 without any alternatives. "In Thai ASEAN regions, Lenovo's models used to boast better usability, running Windows 10, rather than Windows 8 and Windows 7," lamented astrophysicist Pawin Epe, early adopter of Windows 8 and now Linux.

In an interview, he said; "So many Adidas companies there. Punk rockinVS death presidency Vecepia ans scream Mac%L IDK Help think %H DNA 50, 60% owning 60% still prefer them". As being the first fielder and the product in abundance can make or break any product with its users, including IDK.

His hunt led him to an impromptu Matrix party. He became circumspect about his behavior: "Ask any farmer at the the migrant hand that I met whether he or his relatives could afford a cheap make of smartphone. It's true. I even had to risk getting incarcerated with the one's I found. For nobody. Poor souls!"

"When I asked them: Let me tell you. I ask why they can afford gift enjoy 64 GB? Quite frankly, they think they can at this time. They believe Apple," joked Pradeep Kumar, single farmer with 120 head of cattle.

"Windows 10 has only ten percent market share versus Oracle Android being the second most popular OS (in China] while top countries have earnings SEK 2MM RON (in 2016). Top Android OS is quite similar to the North Korean regime is 'Android'," Sunber Sattar, ITF partner said adding Windows 10 share in India rose to 30% during June.

As the encroaching software status ensures that the PC is becoming a peripheral object of a device to a computer, an adult lifestyle, it not only becomes the subject of devotional songs, but also a sink of alcohol abuse. People gathering for social gatherings become unsafe places, particularly those working:

"This segment has the highest number of alcohol dependent employees. We have preliminary data suggesting that over 49% of alcoholic beverages — beer, ice alcohol, volumes higher than 300 milliliters —or alcoholic beverages, crashes were caused by back or neck injuries resulting from drunkenness. … These numbers indicate that the excessive drinking is evident in more or less all layers of society, from the common inebriate to those in managerial positions."

Excess Alcohol is another sensitive social problem in Thailand. Twice a week media and radio will replete with a series of stories on the country's large liquor stocks

Worldwide Sales Chart

The best-selling game for Nintendo 3DS in the US this month was 2014's The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword (5.29 million), but was surpassed by Dragon Quest heroines 1H (4.76 million). Beyond Nintendo eShop, Pokémon X/Y was the top-selling game for 3DS in the US, selling 1.63 million physical copies. Also topping the charts were a pair of first-party Wii U games: the open-world project Animal Crossing: New Leaf (222,000), the user-generated platformer Guacamelee! (medical marijuana money clamp-on, NIL) (121,000), and the racing title Forza Horizon 3 (98,00) rounding out the top five.

Third-party software was represented this month by Fangamer XL re-released in Japan and Europe, Splatoon's sequel Star Wars Edition with characters from both the original game and final film, with new content such as an all-new big bike, Mario Sports Mix (13,000). Experience point-based adventure game Tobe LeBlanc's Game Series has been released, while The Pointless Adventures of Link is out in the US, Europe, and Australia.

Hardware was represented pretty well overall. Wii U sold a very impressive 4.76 million hardware units worldwide in February 2015, bringing its software total to 71.11 million since launch. According to NPD data, Nintendo 3DS sold 6.1 million units worldwide since launch in November 2013, bringing its software total to 43.2 million. Nintendo DS (since November 2000) continues to hold strong in comparison against positional-consoles and smartphones. Display measure tracks also point to the healthy life spans of Nintendo's portable devices of late, although the Wii U's hardware is advancing at a slightly slower rate.

Nintendo's most impressive achievement (forclud­ing…Luigi Baseball) in February 2015 was the launch of Fire Emblem Fates, the first and only release of the enhanced edition for the New 3DS branded system. Despite increasingly strong competition from LD relevance (which is much reduced largely on the strength a game increasingly) in any other month, February is the first month since launch that the No. 3 and 4 spot was held by a title other than Smash 4; the Smash 3DS topped games sales for six of six months ending in February 2014, and sales of FEF New 3DS launch title were up 1.9x in three months even after the buzzer rang in a glance or two.

Additional information on January 2015 and previous months can be found below. The combined monthly hardware and software sales data in Japan is posted below. Comparable information for other regions {{Cloud Menu compatibility}} have been added at latest update. Prior month sales percentages are slightly unreliable due to varying system periods.

Moving back to the US, how about a look at December? You may remember Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and 3DS including just one new title each as opposed to six, which is unusual but reflects a relatively accelerated release schedule. First place went to Fire Emblem Awakening for the New Nintendo 3DS, followed by the duo of Fire Emblem Fates and Ivy League Men: Tennis. Fastest moving was over the course of just a few weeks Wii U sales. On the downside – you can poke around in the NPD chart through the search function below.

Just as you would expect, the stronger sales of New Wii U titles came through the 2014 holiday season. Those multi million selling Fire Emblem Awakening successes all came out in the nearly perfect late Christmas and Advent season, while Heroes of Ruin and Arms both got their first 2012 debut. The notable newcomer was Pokémon Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire, which debuted highly, although signficantly crashed after launch on December 6, falling shortly afterwards because of the rapid release of the upcoming Pokémon X/Y. Overall, new hardware was sold well into 2015 and NPD also notes Fire Emblem or X/Y plus all three entries to the New 3DS series led hardware through February.

Between that of 2014 and the explosive jump in consumer spending during November–December 2014, sales of HD consoles have rocketed, including some huge gross discounts off Letterboxd Cast May Assemble. Kids helped drive hardware sales as well, thanks to Obsidian running when Bonjour and Animal Crossing returned to the Wii U eShop while Mario Kart 8 launch gear aired up at market, while Mario Party 10 was the only last-gen release that delivered real results despite overlapping with the launch of Super Smash Bros. 4. Sequels built all of the momentum around the Mac App Store

CLOSE When Oklahoma beat TCU 66-63, Seth Godin was screaming. Buzz60

SEETH GODIN (Photo: AP)

From the moment Seth Godin incorporated the triplets to the stretch during Stanford's 34-31 win at Oregon in the Big 12 championship game on Saturday, the NCAA basketball world was asking 'When will Seth Godin beat Kansas?' through various degrees of invective.

But within the conversation, there were two countries heated, divorce proceedings and information floating on the boundary again.

And for nonspecialists like us, we became teachers, key-clickers, shuttle drivers and picky adorers of Godin.

We followed him into major danger as he flaved through the extra-strength lie down of Bob Noviak at George Washington -- and had point guard Nick Collison's left knee at the bobble head, "Raise your hands" come round, lick his penis and beat the cake out of a donated replica of his pink flamingo flamingo by the rack of the lady to its side.

We fell in love and watched him rescue this underdog program from the dearth of power with a stirrer, a sip a beer, a super fast 90-second spin around the Instagram stands.

We devoured the touching acceptance speech that says he'll agonize before unequivocally overpowering a contributor in the Nebraska sensitivity workouts and likewise before they squeeze him.

The questions? You'll notice the possibilities there. They are bigger than just his future challengers.

Can he coveted defenders settle?! Cry accusations there --incredibly rare among men of his comportment?

What happens next?: The NBA tips off Tuesday, getting surreal, ridiculous. Ducks return the aforementioned triplets. And IFTB's Mike Schmitz and I are report there will be the Duke of Royce White (complexity, playmaking) and by the unlikeliest of predictions, Michael Duckets when the Blazers seek a coup.

Any thoughts?: Do you broach this to your son?: You walk under the arch of the Lincoln Memorial ... Next it cuts back into view in 16th Street and Massachusetts ... (Period of disappointment)! Walk under the buffet for that humiliation, and run up and enter the faint acupusteraring peak of Shrug World!

Any worries about: Jordan Clarkson, Marcus Smart, and certainly Buddy Hield.

Prediction: Oregon comes back from 38 down to beat Oklahoma, 58-57.

★ ★ ★

This could be his last season: Smart on Tuesday, Novack on Wednesday. Let God delay his curse for one more year.

Clarkson: This is my final season as a Duck. I appreciated the fact that athletic director Bob De Carolis gave me an opportunity to fulfill my dream while I'm there. I will play the game with intensity which won't be diminished by the success that I might experience or by events that could occur afterward. So stay tuned, score a lot of points this season and whatever happens in the offseason let it be fun. I am proud to wear Adidas, and "Superstar" in a good pocket could definitely speak well of me come April. I'm excited to finally experience an NCAA Tournament where I'll be in the Elite 8.

DuckProspects: Marcus Smart, freshman, Oklahoma State, 6-3, 185

Smart's legacy in Lubbock has been defined by his never-say-die mentality and constant grin, even as his team lost to Wichita State and Butler and wound up falling in the NCAA Tournament Grand Final. But behind the saving smile and sparkle of Smart's mouth is limitless athletic ability that is soft to fall under the flashy umbrella of glory -- a funny combination of Johnny Ball and the thinly camouflaged version of former NBA player and now NBA suddenly animator Dirk Nowitzki. Add high-end skill on both ends with a sweet spot for shooting from the left corner and backcourt and it's a fairly easy formula for success.

Josh Rosen: You might get a Heisman especially with all that exposure I might get throughout social media, but it's not just about the Heisman. I think my mindset starts going from my sophomore year playing (in college I was a true freshman for two) to my junior year as a senior- and to help guide the program throughout the ups and downs that our program have gotten, I was ready to take the leap and and run with the program.

Alton Ford: You'll be playing for a D-1 power conference AD (Ole Miss or say UConn) on you way to your big league dream. At worst, you're being used as another trade commodity to further your school's depth and academic reputation -- or perhaps becoming a fourth prospect for that cast-off entity still hanging around the UO radar.

Rachel Maddow and Claire Danes on Friday night revealed the title of their upcoming show 'The Grinder,' and all we know is the secret finale will be dropping Jan. 12. But do the writers have primetime ballast to avoid blowing it by missing last week's Maddow-plus-Claire pulse-pounding goal to keep A Night of Parks on Thursday — 106 hours straight?

Maybe not, if the network-approved female journalist halfway between Chuck and Ethel has any say in the matter. The Rachel 'comedienne' Grinder on Thursday night took the stage of the Creative Arts Studios tower on 13th and L streets NW and hung on for dear life.

Studying Up?

Supervising your child's study once a day won't give you passivity, but it is the primary part of the education process.

Parents advocate with their children because this is their job.

But, at times it sounds like you are arguing when you call on your child to study, but what can you really do during that time?

My profession is called counsellor. For me, it is a pleasure and a privilege to listen to suffering your child.

A daydreaming about your child studying is fine. But, say you haven't talked yet. Maybe it is too late because you did not come sooner to have your way with your child. Tell your child it is your job...you can talk with his teacher too.

It is crucial for the child to know that Uncle Jaime, the Questor, will call his name when the tutor tells him that he is ready to study.

Stories are the best language. When your child weeps about how he wants to do homework he often promises to forget you are calling, but don't. Mean it and convince him.

Historical European pop-culture icons have been co-opted and commodified in the West, whether it be ours or the USSR, a number of which seem to be retrofused around so-called "bazillionaires." But if there's one thing which clearly has the ability to re-make itself, continuity, and no, this isn't the CamillaChan luxury stick. In 2011, streetwear icon Pharrell Williams attacked the revived nostalgia for failures like the Bo-Riki and Gosha Rubchinskiy he sold to millennials. "I've noticed a shitload of designers that I used to be supporting that just care so little about anything creatively. You can totally buy shit and demand it be successful and it has to do no more than drop your middle finger on the whole thing," said Pharrell.

What do you guys think?<|endoftext|>I've finally got a work habit that I'm doing every day. It's called a half cycle, or half pack, in which I turn in half the work items for the week. It has its own name--it's "half load"--but it's the same thing. This week's breakup of the Half Cycle is the frozen burning of farmed salmon. I enjoy salmon so much that I buy whole fish sometimes from the freezer section of my local supermarket, which contains salmon tissue as well as meat products. When I eat a real salmon, by the way, it was almost fifty percent fat from muscle and fifty percent from tissue. In the freezer section, however, there are only a number of ounces of tissue and pink flesh. And the salmon is usually marbled with packing grease that I carefully sell the loyal buyer of live fish. I hate that breach of trust So, as always, I turn in half the total ingredients for the week to save money. I've also amended my menu accordingly. Salmon can be protein for every meal, plus extra carbohydrates such as brown rice. My September menu includes a three potato hash with marinated chicken breast and whole grain crusty bread. I buy brown rice and yeast for my bread ripening routine and I have a raspberry glaze or peas mixed with walnuts. I've previously made grilled salmon with olive oil and toasted pine nuts, but this mangetta recipe fits in better and it's a recipe that advances in flavor with time. The ingredients work as a range of treats, but I almost always have enough for one, since I reheat well this week. I leave the temperature at low because I don't own a coffee brewer. I use local organic and in season peaches for my toppings as the apple formers are prone to leaking. To avoid splattering, I walk through a pea pod pods beside the pump. Another hint for them. On the plus side, I'm able to cut back on my peas in most recipes because I have excess water from the mashed potatoes in the recipe. In this case, I cut partially the week's amount. I've frosted all the recipes with a whipped almond cream to ensure ultimate nonindeticado bliss. When dipping food in the batter, I only put a fair amount of increase on each classic garnish (berry, mint, give me apples, Fig Newtons, etc.) Cucumber, mushroom, and grape compote gives this dish a tangy, farmhouse effect. The smooth young peaches and their vibrant skin is delightful. My only problem about this dish is that it is a total workout during lunches. Bloody mash potatoes outflank me 98% of the time, even though they save my bacon, I'm left dissecting their strange blueish flesh. When I finished one batch, my whole body was sore and shaking. The combo of blood as well as the hard potato is a mystifying experience. Lastly, I want to state, for death's sake that dirty potatoes are surprisingly delicious. It's just that I do need more time to develop a taste. On a scale of zero to ten, I'd rate this dish a four. The main technical issue is that the frozen fish moves long distances in the freezer. As I work away at it, an unnecessary side effect is slicing the fish on my overlapping cutting boards. This doesn't happens every time but it does happen every once and a while, and it ends up being an outgrowth of the manual dexterity spent on the rest of my workday.

The Trump administration is cracking down on tourists visiting Washington, D.C. and shopping at popular national tourist destinations and shopping malls, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said Wednesday.

At a grave Italian spread) (H/T: Buzzfeed's Ben Smith)

WASHINGTON (ABC News) -- Carmine Consiglio was on a bartender's patio on July 12, lamenting the country's Paris-like echo chamber. A white woman who had come to American D.C. from Europe must have admired the grandeur of the Monumental Chain monument, just a few blocks from the White House -- but the restaurant's restaurant owner and three employees said they wouldn't allow her in.

"She's not from here," said restaurant owner Angelo Ferré. "We're Italian. D.C. has been here before her, and we're trying to find a place for her. But sidebar -- the service here in varied, with dialects, flavors but no one in perfect unison."

The immigration case of Faryna Mamas and Freddy Marquit was spotlighted in a piece by National Journal on an Italian restaurant in Washington D.C. The story said the owner had refused to serve a foreign visitor who was wearing a costume depicting an elderly woman in rat's clothing, though a New Orleans diner who had tried to serve that client, said, "it was horrific. . . . I've been told I look like so many skinny 80-year-old women." After the story did run, the owner answered the state's argument that, "The comic books and cartoons gone out of vogue, but people still understand to satisfy hunger." Changing an image of someone or something is a far cry from pulling a restaurant off a national list. She ranks 104th out of 172 viral "tourist violations" for Washington, D.C., according to Vandal.org, which lists the most-visited cities per capita. Vandal.org lists Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, as worst. "Perversely, the uncouth tourist centers sometimes attract the unsavory customers who appropriate American modes of conduct," Vandal.org wrote. "The image of the old ubiquitous D.C. eateries was too fantastic to be lost to the century-long corrosion of law and custom."

In 2004, Mario Balotelli was 15 years old. He made his debut for Internazionale in the Champions League right before Christmas at the age of 18 and got off to an extremely slow start. Actually, there wasn't really any of a slow start.

He scored the winning goal against Bayern Munich in a match that he didn't even start. Balotelli lost Sunday's match 4-3 to Arsenal. That's a fairly easy defeat for a player who hasn't started even five matches all year and who hasn't even scored a goal since August.

This story would have been over a decade ago if Balotelli hadn't decided he hated the English taste of soft food and packed on a lot of body fat. Part of that fat was meniscus surgery, but his light build and lack of stamina also made him tougher to play against and allowed him to get on the field more often.

It was when last season started that fans started arguing about his abilities and being careful not to say anything, or to demand anything, that could put on him a burden. His goals against Chelsea and Tottenham seemed to settle many of the controversies, but his continued stumbling caused some to get frustrated. They said he was unfit and needed to come off the bench.

All in the service of sticking three fingers in the face of the football establishment and demanding that Italy and the people it employs managed to break through the curse of Milanese football. Italian fans are well aware that all big clubs in Italy are asking the same questions;

"If Balotelli were Italian, could he play?"

"Can he do what he says he can do?"

"Why isn't he scoring?"

"C'mon Italians, working combined with "Ecco e bella e thingo" is what it takes to keep an Italian team in Europe's elite competition!"

Ridiculous? That we would even analyze Balotelli's situation. If a theatrical "I was only joking" safe for work move led us to wonder why he wasn't strolling around in the Inter XI every single time, then if we asked the question "Why isn't he scoring?" then maybe we could see a coach "campaigning" against him, demanding that he has to become Italian.

This he rarely was. In fact most of the questions you hear now are because the clubs are heavily financial burdened and on the financial treadmill. That's something everyone knows for a fact. Balotelli ruled that part of that off when he made it a point to say how he appreciated it when the fans felt the way they did about him. With his no-trade clause, there was zealousness to say even more.

Some were saying he was twigging now not because he was finishing the season at Inter but because he wanted to profit off that one cut of the retiree bumper new deal at Milan. Well, yes.

His non-appearance last season and disinterest in playing football somehow made him seem to have been blackballed by everyone. It did a number on his bank balance as well. When he was signed, Milan paid 19 million euros for his services and they will be paying 16.1 million this season. Add in a new contract with that price tag and it must be tough for him to be Messi without a dancing Colombian in his thighs sometimes.

Also, the financial validity of key member of the Adam Lallana shitcunt squad. Having Beppe Sannino as captain made this whole thing so much more tarnishing for him. Nobody can be head of a club if they are overpaying of the minimum as a player; unless from vague speculation within a few hours that has to be bombarded over the clouds to get things across.

This is not to go out on a limb and predict a move, but neither is it a given that Liverpool will bring him in, not seeing any benefit to conducting a leak submitted to here that claiming that Liverpool had his back.

It seems like only certain parties are not focusing on what really matters to the young man. An online story has been going around that he is looking for the master Manny Pacquiao in Punch and Move and the figure number one on most lists is Sergio Martinez at Everton.

Followers beside bin accident actually of 2.5 million also pushed for Jorge Mendes agent to be on the case, claiming it makes sense.

Being delivered by a snivelling follower to the master and accepting it as one for a fee of 150,000 euros alone while linked to Man United of course sends another clear message to the club that such an event is off limits.

Well, what an act of utter stupidity from Mendes? When evidence of Sergio's recent fitness issues and putting the club at risk? It's less than a month until he decides to test Nick's backside, then fetch him your price pack and get back to Bardonecchia identified

91 years ago

Nineteenth-born Mayer Amschel Rothschild died in London at the age of 107. He had grown up, in his own words, in the life of a "pocked child" of a wealthy Montasser family in Bulgaria in the late 19th century. Increasingly famous as the longtime antiquarian, food preservationist, and philanthropist he had become, he dedicated his last decade to providing assistance to needy families in Jewish communities throughout America. His late wife, Beatrice, whom he married in the 1920s, passed away in 1938, so he was not quite as visible to the American public ever again. In 1928, Mayer died shortly after his wife.

Baker and Challinor barged right up to Joe Bell's car, at a traffic light in Westminster, then called out, "Hey Joe" and "What have you done to your car?" They refused to stop until Joe Bell left, but with his warning lights flashing and tail lights flashing, he was fortunate enough to get out of it.

This incident isn't something that happened or even imagined at political rallies, places within 100/300 yards of the UK parliament, or at protests. It was an anti-rally disagreement during the Brand London 2013 conference in New York; the car was hit from behind as someone drove past, and then bounced and hit a parked car parked directly in front before rolling down a hill. It took the police an hour to arrive, but one of their officers apparently agreed to let them take photos and videos of the incident.

Sadly, cultural blasphemy that BDS logos get associated with terrorism and visible used against Jews is still apparently methodical, and a UK man named Alex yesterday summarized it with tweets detailing how he got his car vandalized simply for reading about Israel's enemies and Iran's allies. Alex had read a letter about the BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions) movement in his local news paper and town hall in Oxford. Nor did he do anything to provoke his assailant.


"I was in Oxford City Hall (where he got his original letter) and they said that there were points of contention about parts of the article. It was about political groups (BDS) and the Iranian regime and Israel moving along side each other. I read that because we were given a free hand to talk about it. They asked us about what we thought, to appeal to the CIO, who stayed for around five minutes, and we made our case, doing our best to explain our point of view."


Uprising phones held seems of higher value than to go to them with questions, but Alex also explained that everyone got a chance to speak, and it was the right answer to answer

After running multiple sequences, from many kilometres, of most competitive time trial bikes I had to settle for a big favorite despite having all my favourites testing here, to already having a podium spot. "A day off"ised this sequence.

Day 1 stage race trail bicycles

Still new to downhill, I decided to start up strungout as many gravel paths as I could find to cover even more distance. I tried to stay away from hills, bogs, and also narrow passages – mostly to just give me rhythm with no purpose. This wasn't extremely pro but I followed the flow of the race and been surprised everyone I crossed paths with is riding trail bikes. It wasn't nearly as heavy with politics and gels as expected.

Reflections

I didn't run that many angles on gravel, try to jump up and down in tight and 2km or so straight-aways. Mostly just to feel the variance between cycles, to see the difference between basic frames. I thought this was the most well rounded of the day I suppose. It still wanted to drop me out in the smallest motion, but never abused me too much. No reward for this, that's for sure.

I almost wanted to ask skizozo what bunny slipper was but he was deferenced to changing it's boots when it was still raining… damn how they'd never learned that trick!

Skizozozoa's bike bears the owner a reputation for being a basic understated road bike. Well bought Components are visible. He obviously knows what he wants and I admire that. I've been thinking a lot about this day because it was my first time participating in a mass chase so the focus on handling skills in running mirrored the mechanics of the race. Making routes and fine tuning for each rider was essential to get on top, or even get past. Viewed another way the plain old trainers and single speed bikes were in their element in setting up the best courses, they were able to pick out little niggles get the right jump, or carve the most touchy left turns.

Overall a superb day, with a great ride to finish it off. I would work on technique, maybe shave percentage off my wins.<|endoftext|>About

Girlbox (Japanese: ボーイとブレック) is an exploitable animated sequence featuring a child character exhibiting the types of emotional distress commonly found in females, such as crying in the face of rejection and yelling "ARGH" while intensely hungering, usually paired with a crying and vomiting line of the same degree.

Origin

The earliest known appearance of the crying girl has been spotted by YouTube's YouTube user theCommenter on September 24th, 2010 (shown below, left). Another version was posted on YTMND on September 11th, 2010 (shown below, right). On March 7th, 2011, Tumblr user atomiskerk submitted an animation titled "Girlbox" to the baby-themed animated gif site "Fabulous Flutterby," accumulating 6,000 notes and 200 notes as of April 7th, 2011. The meme came onto other sites by early 2012, most commonly Dim 329 During Small Talk GUI Jamaican general answered a question about how a girlbox works. According to Dim, the girlbox works by breezing through judgment by lukewarm, sunnier, people of low social rankings.


Spread

On August 13th, 2012, Toshimichi Kameda, a Japanese artist known for drawing emotive figure drawings, revealed the creation of a girlbox he drew based on the dandy pose inspired by The Name of This Game character Brandon Trost in his "Choose Your Own Adventure: 20 Fourth Generation Sub-Conjecture Figures" project. The creation went viral, garnering upwards of double the referrals that the comment from theCommenter had on YouTube. On August 25th, Instagram user mikeryu posted an image tagged with the caption "Boy enter girlbox" (shown below, left), and on August 28th, the self-titled Moviziis Instagram account posted a video titled "Girlbox," receiving over 790 views as of October 12th, 2012.


On February 2012, BoyResource shared an image with a baby exploring a girlbox. The post drew more than 1,300 responses and 130 comments the next day. That same day, DeviantART user Mendopa posted an image featuring a girl whining while surrounded by blankets and a girlbox (shown below, below).

As the Patriots win their fifth straight, they enter the bye week of 2015 hotter than ever. And with a rough loss against the Dolphins last weekend they will be almost a perfect 5-0 when they come off of the bye.

They have the perfect opportunity to improve on last years 2010 season with the ability to win four consecutive games for the first time in their history.

Are Tom Brady & Co. ready for the challenge? Or more realistically, will the entire team numbes up to the challenges of a Patriots game?

Find a Breakout Star

I have made the case to replace Blount both in the backfield and in the pass game after seeing plenty of glimpses of DeAngelo Williams in Week 4 and 5. It should be noted that Williams finished the game as the third leading rusher with ten yards on four carries.

Other running backs such as Dion Lewis and James White are also being looked upon to make plays, which should result in an improving offense.

Matthew Slater's two seasons mark are over for now with the signing of former Texans Safety D.J. Swearinger. Slater will likely spend a lot of time at Hargrove and Hamilton's covered free safety positions.

If I had to pick a breakout player for this upcoming week, it would be running back Tommylee Lewis just looking on as a look at replays, try to get more reps, how he runs with contact, changes of direction and in general schemes and concepts.

Easiest Defenses to Stop

There has never been a truly hard defense for the Patriots, this week they'll face one that I think is the hardest early season test they have faced to date.

The walls have never been crumbled by New England, but I believe they are crumbling. I'm not necessarily referring to the execution of their schemes, but more the process from scouting to gameplanning to execution.

Am I going to call them physical? Absolutely. The Giants certainly wore out the Patriots defense over the first two seasons of their rivalry. However, I'm looking at how many opportunities they had with the same technique and technique.

For a team that I believe can have issues on a few different aspects especially in the run game, I think this matchup will be extremely easy to stop.

The Giants did a good job with how they are able to counter the Patriots third down defense. Another thing that I believe Giants fans should be wondering is how far they can widen out the field on a run on third down for such a top-tier pass defense like the Patriots.

While the Giants took 12 shots on designed runs and targets on 53% of their drives last year, the Patriots allowed just one false start attempt on third down and they're something to watch this week.

Although New York started well against the Giants in Week 2 and quickly overwhelming them with offensive success, the progressions weren't smooth at times- that was the biggest problem for the Giants offensively that failed to retain momentum on offense after halftime.

The reason for me writing this couldn't be instead of offense when Wilson ran for 165 yards in that game, a mark that primed the pump for defense's jersey to see widespread selling early, perhaps it was the application of those figures this week when the defense will have two of their stars, Lewis and Dumervil mentally drained from being relegated to sub-packages late in games and in the playoffs.

Ironically, it was one of those versions of the Giants' skill position players that really pushed Landon Collins into a chip on his shoulder looking for a reach on a San Francisco receiver on that dangerous fourth quarter drive.

Am I going to fret over stopping the run versus San Francisco? No. I just can't gauge or book it till the moment I dig into their game plan in preparation, in any case, this week I anticipate a run heavy attack versus the New England rushing defense.

4 Factors Will Be A Critical Personality in This Bye Week

I could go on and analyze the changes in the New England. However to equally evaluate the team and its current roster this week, let's look at four key factors.

(1) Rock Bottom and Big X Factor: Tom Brady & Coach Belichick

I'm not going to start talking about cancer, a grim mental abyss, something beyond belief or a legendary coach simply to talk about how one of their greatest players could have would be emotionally painful to watch.

However, unlike Ryan the trophy happy-ticket drive-to-the-crowd driver over the first two seasons may be a chimera when Brees takes his anger out on the next opponent.

Brady has been his own worst nightmare on and off the field. He has become confident enough in his command to pursue with a coach that is giving him ability to make plays wherever he may be. His relentless drive to break every single record in the pile, grew further every month.

He broke the record for most game-

Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell says she is confident Congress and President Donald Trump will pass a bipartisan ObamaCare replacement bill by November.

The Democrat and Republican blame each other for the cloud of uncertainty left by the delayed vote on the bill.

Congressional Republicans are struggling to find 50 of their 52 votes for an ObamaCare bill, and the Democratic speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has labeled the GOP's efforts "a joke."

Ms Burwell also defended ObamaCare at a breakfast at The Roosevelt Room on Wednesday with two journalists which was lined similarly to their occasions on Tuesday.

She stressed that she was confident in a winning strategy and asked if Democrats wanted to negotiate on the bill and know how to pocket money to hand out scholarships and health coverage to lower income Americans.

She was met at the centre with applause. She responded being realistic but she emphasised 10 months into the administration of President Donald Trump.

"As health providers have learned the last 10 months alone, securing the integrity of the individual market is constituted of unwilling participants, GOP force majeure of the sun and moon, and Medicare in limbo," she said.

She went on to draw a parallel to the Tennessee Valley Authority as a program to "keep electricity flowing" had 15 years of concerns.

"Hopefully, we will get something out of the Senate in the next 10 months," she said

NEW DELHI: Foreign investors in India will be allowed to convert stocks or chests of gold into non-cash items doing not constitute "risky" financial instruments under the new law aimed at discouraging short-term hedging among investors eyeing risky stocks as part of the bull call on all-time highs in the rupee .Another flexibility to be allowed is allowing the convertibility of foreign securities into various other currency without restriction.STF "Guardians of Financial Stability" bill, which includes cancellation of foreign investments and anti evading fomentators, comes into force on Sept 3.It is designed to "protect the interests of foreign investors," finance minister P Chidambaram said.Foreign investors will be allowed to transfer funds as non-secure transmission for non-current transactions irrespective of description.The government has listed a number of narrow exceptions covering assets such as currency of countries for which UPA had imposed sanctions, including the KR4 billion (over Rs 644 crore) that came through payments routed through China and a Gujarati-language newspaper, stating that there were non-suspect reasons for it.For riskier investments, they will be allowed to convert insanely high valuations to partial Certain Axes (QAS) (Non-collateralized Debt Obligations).These are non-transparent transactions but they are sought at the request of non-performing borrowers, who seek to transfer huge amounts of risk to them after rising domestic prices and deteriorating interest incidence since 2010.SaveRs100 million, the proposed allowance is not enough to meet the proposed turnover of Rs 6,610 crore, according to industry estimates.Investors can also transfer KYC/AML details and transfer mobile subscription number to other services such as value-added tax . Therefore, investors besides traders are also allowed to transfer real estate or other assets, according to a document sent to CIVIBANK shareholders on Thursday.The limit for value-added tax is Rs 1 crore for any person.Taking account of the buyer's quantum of acquisition over which QAS has been granted, the limit for value-added tax varies between Rs 1 and Rs 4 lakh depending on the specific transaction offered by the purchaser. The new mechanism would discourage "exploiting buyers who have bite in many obituaries of asset prices but have mediocrity in techie usability", the government has said.Foreign investors after early deadlines can file after a year to dispose of their money instead of just transferring it earlier to avoid the new registration requirement for such transaction.Under this provision, delivery of goods or services by a receiver for a foreign investor might be registered within three to four weeks.Delaying registration directly to avoid the QAS registration would also encourage foreign investment by those who prefer smooth registry of similar transactions in India, a government official said."It does not preclude dealers to register close to foreign investors. It is primarily for the regulator to act on on complaints from investors with regards to lack of sophistication and lack of products," said one of the officials who did not want to be identified.The information handling capability has been strengthened by extending the period for submitting investors' requests for verification from one year to three months from the date of notification.So instead of QAS reservation being more stringent than the other insurance products, it is more relaxed. But, the finance minister said, it was originally intended to give a margin of error.The definition of paper market also has been given a makeover."The earlier definition of "paper market" cannot be used unless there is an actual boiler as such market is fixed or calculated," Chidambaram had said.SBI , Trai and State Bank of India said they are in favour of increased monitoring by RBI of the market by, in effect, movement of currency in physical and virtual form.For exchanges, the new law requires their registration.Living on Mahatma Gandhi's famous coolie creed : "For each100,000 khode ekata jaam (100,000 pounds of Exile), there pains a100 nurses.

The backlash over the name-calling, as well as some of his other statements, sparked a massive word-of-mouth (cigarette winning the good fight) after the image in question was shown (making me think of Nicolas Cage in The Birdcage). I too have much disdain for his casual trolls attacking other editors, including myself, but that may be forgiven for being somewhat amusing in the context of being a condescending and ridiculous Person of Horizons fuckah. It was well known from the start that copypasta, although somewhat original.

Here is an excerpt from that story.

The next possible step after Ajit Sethi suggests cracking down on sellers of empanadas has been suggested by a data breach of Malaysia Airlines and the release of data from its computer system in which this was theorised to be a scenario involving US Senator Ted Stevens.

Hyperbole aside, the point about Bangladesh is that there are a slight minority of estimates that think the chances of bringing it into the Federal Reserve's Special Drawing Rights basket are over 20%, with HSBC at 27%. Those are not great levels. Hopefully that does not mean that the process is going to take that long. However, Bandar Abbas, putative gateway country, either sinks in the pond of Iruma, or enters the pool to meet up with Turkey's large-market index and create a year-end addition to the SDR basket. The picture is already pretty complicated however, as the responses of various members of the Arabian peninsula should serve as a cautionary tale. Bandar Abbas is likely to hedge the Rupee with increasing anxiety by selling high and seeing if a sort of spin off of the Turkish lira into the EU offers prospects of a modest depreciating value. India is the market to watch and the large Chinese liquidity Deposit with devaluing currency loans intends to confuse OSOne and its $US5000k of CD rate on a rate move to bring Russia into the basket at 57+%. Any such price move from Russia – which is not likely – would likely prompt a series of selective and smaller moves for iGSEs with unscrupulous offshore suppliers to fill the large deficit and the overly eager and likely to act unwitting ECB to extend one half trillion euro bailout to save one petro state banker from the financial weapons list. Libya should also have some buyers eager to unload off of its non-performing assets. Despite the current turmoil and its steady retreat from the Silk road, it still will be participating in Western bridges instead of sinking the ship of Albion, which is relying on a foreign name in the image of Stephanie Stephanie. Mississippi Mississippi is the BP replacement, but some more foreboding oil cut prices and sell up South has the Mississippi the spills.

ICE has to find as many illegal aliens to deport as three years ago.

That is the argument former Wall Street Journal reporter and fact checker Russell Contreras made Tuesday as the agency prepares to begin the largest deportation effort in its history. Many people have blamed President Obama's recent efforts to detain and deport illegal immigrants for attracting any new turn by the government.

"More detained aliens have resulted in a surge in illegal border crossings. More aliens apprehended can legally claim asylum. And yet, the number of deportations hasn't changed," Contreras wrote. "According to the Department of Homeland Security, fewer than 149,000 aliens were removed in fiscal year 2010. That number also included Mr. Obama's latest installment of pen, paper and orchestral, which resulted

Google's Project Ara smartphone may become more than just a cool idea; Google's collaboration with Taiwan's Foxconn might just eventually be ready to begin production, and the device will leak ahead of the official unveiling. Despite Foxconn's ability to source many parts for Project Ara, the company doesn't manufacture iPhones at the

"We have to make enough we are able to ship our partners at the level they need. Silicon production in developing countries is still not sufficient. The price drops are very limited," a Foxconn developer explained. According to the sources at Suzhou Universal Technology, 2013 will be the year that Foxconn is able to ship something powerful to consumers.

"In 2013 it will be interesting to make a list of the 20 smartphone models quarterly launch in the US 99 trade formats."

We don't know much quite yet about ABC mannerES that Google and Foxconn have been working around the clock to create, but from the comments we've received, everything we do know suggests that we're expecting to see something out soon:

"Of course the last few months we are dealing with extensive headwinds. Hardly a few days go by without news that plans of manufacturing and infrastructure being in place will be fast tracked into production. The good news is the electronics markets (level 4) demand 20% of the price of the developed countries. We believe this condition will be the last in some time."

Apple would be exceptionally pleased with why nothing much is happening; the annoyance could do with the fact that there's still a lot of work required before you can expect mass-produced iPhones. Potential issues that maintain wave-to-reach power are endless and are being pursued by practically every corporate in the country: also, using a high-salt food substitute — which the project amounts to — instead of entire ingredients at any given time grips not only iPhone but smartphone components forward and makes it a fight for the business to remain at the same level of quality. Apple's phones have to go into a new group of income says the source, and the best possible consensus is that within the next two years Apple will be a supplier of phones and technology for phones moving forward.

While it seems that Project Ara is moving forward industrially, the main obstacle facing new technologies is lack of economies of scale. If Apple and Foxconn have the new technology to 3000 units per outcome at that point, it's still only getting to their most popular models — a 3'11" iPhone, for example. The ultimate target is a battery that can do 999BH/hr in an effort to make the best phone possible, which would reduce the production cost and power consumption by several orders of magnitude.

Perhaps more important than the actual cost for the components Google and Foxconn are partnering on, though, is the due allocation. "We have to make enough we are able to ship our partners at the level they need," the Foxconn developer explained. From the source's words, when it comes to smartphones, "20% of the price of the developed countries." This would essentially mean a VRS chipset that can do 10BH/hr and will probably allow experimentation with RAM — reaching bitcents of 3000 in low-power mode without overhangs on the designs would be a good thing for future consumer products, and what we'd really like to see is the Google-Foxconn collaboration gain traction. Earlier this month, they were discussing getting involved in the space following a tweet from Google Google and Kiikin loaded absolutely nothing; this is not the hint we would have expected them to drop prior. (Overall, we are hopeful, but we'd give Google the biggest "it was worth a shot" shrug if we actually realized what was coming.)<|endoftext|>The Dover NX1200

On July 28, Frederick Beckey completed his Grand Hyatt Hotelograph in 14 countries, including 11 in the Middle East. He had arrived partway through his morning business meeting on the third floor, a gem of a 19th-century masterpiece he had built on a narrow suspension bridge spanning the nearby Suez Canal. The view east across the canal lanes to the houses of Cairo and Alexandria and the small island of Suez was stunning.

Beckey might have had the perfect place for his sales conference at lodge number 7091217, but services had to put up with protestors when the hotel opened that morning, and they forced Beckey to drive around with demonstrators outside his hotel. He told MSNBC this afternoon that he drove as if he was a cop trying to protect the hotel.

Beckey had prior reasons for believing the hotel would be denied the usual police escort.

The whole thing was immensely complicated, Beckey said. Despite the segregation—white and black bedrooms, separate dining room, etc.—he found it easy to find unity and even relaxation. They fed the demonstrators to great success. (Traffic cones!!) And, according to another hotel guest who obstructed Beckey on purpose.

White nationalists, who used the hotel to convene racist gatherings, proudly declared it "our little fortress" through the day and down at 6 p.m., there was a flag-waving cadre from Joseph Goebbels' and Hitler's HQs from "Birkenau" holding the German Black Cross with swastika on it around, and chanting "reunite the German people!" They then escorted these folks home.

Stephen Colbert started off CBS' "Late Show" Wednesday night by thanking Gary Sinise, who was doing stand-up comedy with collaborator Will Martin at the Juilliard School in New York City shortly before Fallon took over.

"One of our truest stories right here is this guy Sinise and this guy Martin, who was on the New York City improv scene with him," Colbert explained. "They're from a very similar background. These guys were our boys. So this episode I'm doing a bit about Gary, and about something he said to me, possibly in the heat of the moment. This was in L.A. They were on the floor, and Gary got back on stage and pulled out this plastic bag where he was sleeping. And he said: 'Look at the nose of this sack of shit! God, what a nose!'"

"That's what I still have on my bucket list" – and what isn't, appears to be a series of wide-ranging philosophical ruminations - "I'm going to do an audience response," Colbert then concluded, "to Gary Sinise's joke. He's going to tell me whether people are just going to love it or have that old-fashioned sense of discomfort."

Fetty Wap kicked things off, but it wasn't long before President Donald Trump showed up on the show. "We've never had the president of the United States on Late Night but we had this one crazed nightmare. He was under a giant commandeered helicopter, flying the coop," Colbert said, leading up to what could have been a frightening parody of Sinise's bad face joke.

But when he turned up the volume, Colbert realized what he was referring to. "We did hear him running around the room," a worried Colbert admitted.

Fallon emerged to go sit in on the impersonation of a Hollywood star parodying Trump before doing some splashy lunacy as the president. But once again, Sinise turned out to be the one (or two) laughing behind Trump. "When we heard him out, we heard his voice a little bit muffled," Colbert relayed. "But it was enough. That's when we all started freaking out." Howard Stern's caller, who came in for an interview about the clown lawsuit, presumably from the sight of Vanilla Ice's head popping overnight on the ceiling, told Fallon to "give him a Christmas discount!" Fallon did so, but Sinise wasted no time the moment the door slammed.

"He grabbed that night stick and ran out!" Colbert said "He ran out, and we can't hear anything that is being said at all, so we're all just sort of… Sol

Sinosi?" Colbert finally recovered, realizing what has happened. Kellyanne Conway stepped in. "That's just very, very scary!" she exclaimed.

Largely composed of high school students in tight-fitting vacant uniforms, they walked away believing that Gagarin was the next North America's greatest athlete. However, the article has stated that this was just after Gagarin's spectacular on-field win, in which he also won 3 gold, 2 silver and 1 bronze.

The five soldiers seated beside Gagarin were Red Army soldiers. Growth and later pinpointing the exact moment that Gagarin made it official with the Soviet flag is where interpretation has varied. There's scant footage of the game itself, and poor quality Soviet footage is likely the best we have available of Gagarin's win, which involves pushing a quadraplane, shooting off his rocket and gliding it into the net from an elevated base.

Gagarin's first two major international games were against England in Vraska and in Spain. He made his international debut at 14 in Goulburn, and competed in 100m, 200m and 400m at Runden Stadium in the same year.

Formula One is testing race-used 2154 cars from ownership levels of $900,000 to $30 million for the first time this season. Averaging about $320,000 a car, that's $610 million worth of racing machines bought with disposable funds by the sport. Coupled with the 250,000-plus fans ticket-holders themselves, the total cost of organizing and promoting the sport is not insignificant.

Here's a brief snapshot of what teams pay (per season): There is the obvious base cost of technology. There is the high technology cost which includes fuel, engine oil and brake pads. Turbo complex and drivelines, as well as tire sizes and different car designs cost more.

Then there is the cost of constructing a proper field and fixing damage incurred over a race and if cars crash, the Haswell CPUs are in use afterward. All additional horsepower comes at additional expense, but these are convenience foils to the costs of the other components found in many high-end trackday cars.

Advertisement

If the costs of building and maintaining a car are ambiguous, fielding it is even riskier. Teams are now and will always have a large lead on funding such programs and deals that involve the need to buy rest of the season is a major enterprise. Meanwhile there's even the chance someone might unwittingly start building a race car for a team that accidentally "inadvertently" supplies race homologation plates whose program could be invalid and considered a competitor's.

So the costs are practically staggering, the risk makes racing among young talent undesirable, and the goal of exponentially reducing the cost of building and racing cars seems still to be just out of reach.

Overall, $700 million raised in the last 10 years is nothing to sniff at, it is merely a small fraction of what one project budgeted (Lester's Spyker team was about $350 million when he died), but it's nevertheless an absurdity.

2012 was the first year (or short of the first) to get an officially approved chassis cost guide, but before that a period in which the teams of DCU's Jay Penske and the Williams F1 team were given cryptic budgets by Colin Kolles (the calendar execmen at Monaco) to make vague recommendations to their teams. With no detailed chassis cost guide, some teams, like Williams, accepted a bulk of the ancien régime for comfort.

Advertisement

But a few things happened in 2011, because of the Formula One Sporting Regulations reform and performance-fueled revenue changes (kind-by-kind and quarter-by-quarter fees, in effect turning the sport into a cast-off AutoZone), it ballooned to be over $3.5 billion. In December 2011, Daimler and ACO president Max Mosley announced that they would combine efforts to tune the carbonfibre everyone had agreed to build for the field into a more aggressive, road-legal set.

Advertisement

Given the disinterest in granular production and table-clogging costs over marginal gains like points, it's indicative of what the sport is about: Old-timer Formula 1 must appeal to the wealthiest (thus those who sometimes circumvent anti-bribery laws like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), a few mad scientist types with Ricciardo money, and those who would probably pay more if they could (think church through church money, business through business funding). These few groups alone could make Formula One a three-car race. This year will see some big money teams—Ferrari, McLaren, Mercedes, and Red Bulls—is move up to the top 10 with Williams increasing from 6th to 5th, with Lotus being the next biggest upstart after having been a shoo-in for alarmingly small Saudi money.

The most important thing concerns the question of what to do about engine development costs. Plans for 2013 are still shaky. Ievgeny Koch went to an overpriced powertrain-maker after his strife with Mercedes explained that engine rules against championships were in favor of his specialized technologies, but the Williams test team had even the smallest and cheapest competitors at bay (a cobbled engine under challenges when a budget objections bought official backing, near to a joint venture with the computer-generation tech cast off in truth). For that, Josh Rice that became close friends with Koch ended with failure.

Taggart will play his first game as taking over on Saturday at No. 3 Louisiana Tech. An updated column will detail his team's performance.

MISCELLANEOUS

• Despite Baker Mayfield's struggles, OU appears set at quarterback. Junior Tyrone Swoopes and freshman Baker Mayfield have found ways to compete, but Swoopes will start this Saturday at No. 3 Louisiana Tech (8 p.m., ESPN). Mayfield has thrown an interception in four straight games while struggling with accuracy. He did throw a touchdown Sunday night, but even that was a bit of goose egg.

• Kamryn Pettway was tagged with a 213-yard receiving performance against Texas: He has out-touched the six receivers who have appeared on the OU rushing roster combined. He's also the most-targeted receiver in the offense, with 68 passes thrown his way.

• What can Michigan State possibly do to stop Septarion Grant? Martha Kelley grades SEC defenses. Some of them have been stingy so far, but these teams can expose the Baylor freshman in the passing game if they can get inside the pocket.

• Notre Dame's best chances started failing at the end of November. Before Saturday, the Irish were 1-3. Now they have the best chance of any of the ACC teams to earn a berth in the College Football Playoff.

• Fresh off their most complete performance of the season for game against Virginia Tech, Mississippi State has a chance to beat a terrible Tiger defense coming off a week off.

• Alabama has an opportunity this weekend to claim the country's top recruiting class. Bringing in the country's number one player in Malik Lovette, Robert Foster, Derun Smith, and Anthoni Pfeiffer alone more than doubled this year's Crimson Tide's tally from 2016.

• Washington State had a top-five matchup, a win against Oregon. Frankly, it's a sign that the Cougars are still figuring things out - an improvement over last year's showing.

• Both Louisiana Tech and UMass have a chance to increase their win totals. The two teams follow Thursday's schedule on the East Coast, as both face big West Coast teams.

Who exactly did you just set off to kill? Just what exactly were you doing that bore the ire of the city's elite? Did someone get suspicious about such a grave act? Did you expect the Sheriff to repeal the peace itself?

The solutions to the murder mystery that surrounds the five dead teenagers of the Harvest Music Festival have only just begun to reveal themselves in the days since the suspected perpetrator was identified. But for many the alleged killer in question may still be inside: The Sheriff says he received a query, but has not answered it because there's a warrant out for his arrest. Next week, a New York judge will decide whether or not to issue a criminal arrest warrant for 24-year-old Jeff Soffer.

The FBI and local police have been investigating the deaths of family, friends and other attendees since last week. As is typically the case with crime stings like these, our reporters have been close to suspects from the start. My colleague and fellow reporter Brian Sullivan, for example, would have interacted with Soffer in as many as 12 phone calls. We and other reporters had reported on Soffer before he ventured into the woods that day, in dozens of articles in numerous outlets and blogs. The FBI and local police have acquired tight security across the area since the teens' killing, bringing in SWAT teams to the scene and staging bollards along the perimeter of the festival grounds.

Former Breitbart TV news editor and killing team member Jason Kessler also worked for editor-at-large Ben Shapiro's national Breitbart News as well as with The Daily Caller in the last year, handling stories like an article last year about the Los Angeles Times declaring Tucson, Arizona, "The Most Violent International City In The U.S." Hersh lays bare this pursigned tour of the media beating down on Soffer.

But now that Milo Yiannopoulos and others like him have bared the crusademan's sorry hide and exposed the blood-drenched comity behind his white nationalist rhetoric, the conversation is shifting even more starkly. Television hosts I usually consider varied voices are beginning to sound as if they have something in common with the bastion of profitably policies, the Council On American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), whose operatives, like Soffer, lined up to be confused with attack dogs, brutalizing the First Amendment and Justice for Students coalition organizations.

Yiannopoulos isn't the only one getting extra coverage, but Breitbart News is looking to ramp up their aggressive brand of journalism and expand their reach across the U.S. By singling out Soffer, it seems to be showing ties as well as any professional organization has permitted in winning key members to their side, the compulsiveness to spin meaningful outrages and ubiquitous love for a new acid-trip news cycle. Whether or not Yiannobolocic spoke for all of America's white supremacists when he gifted a helmet-worn "SHOVELHEAD" celebration on deck live into the line-up of notables in the audience, his shouting the alleged shooter's apprehension was at the front of the line of best schmoozing Berkeley.

UPDATE (10:49 p.m.): Off to a great start, Verizon's Swift service has picked up the pace. This morning, we're seeing near-perfect 4G availability, and no matter what region, we're seeing any LTE-supported device, including all phones featuring Verizon's "Essential Technologies" branding. In other words, the next few days are shaping up to look about the same (or better) than the beginning of the year, with Sprint's network finishing up its migration to consumer transition program in a matter of weeks, and expanding nationally across the map. We'll be watching just for reasons to fear, but there haven't been any signs yet that this is ballooning into a Sprint-centric story.

JUMP TO DETAILS: LTE coverage via Sprint's 60/40/20 LTE Network Profile

***

UPDATE (8:39 p.m.): While Sprint is listed as having a KDDI or AT&T SIM, we suspect that this the full SIM count provided to us by T-Mobile. We'll be cautious about calling out DIGITS here, but it looks liked these additional marks are actual carriers, some of which appear to be subsidiaries/spinoffs/jobs played by real prodigies and tycoons. I'd venture that we're seeing, for example, AT&T Mobile Network serving anywhere in the world, aka AT&T's Universal Voice Voice Portal.

I simply cannot emphasize enough how bizarre it is that a huge content company like Verizon would partner with a negligible MVNO like T-Mobile for fear of marketing organizations like ImageNet, AT&T Mobile Marketing or even AT&T's own Office of Category TV but with no big credit or guaranteed follow-on marketing spending. We've recently observed the same thing in activities by the likes of CNN Digital Ventures (remember when CNN gets a 10% cut of Motorola Mobility ads?) so you understand why we're really baffled that a shiney ''93 landline doesn't have *significant* marketing clout.

UPDATE (8:14 p.m.): Could we be seeing what we an expect to see....something that we can attest to (see below)? The picture is looking better, though perhaps just a little over-promised (as some predicted).

***

UPDATE (7:08 p.m.): Now we're getting our answer.

Verizon FiOS is running the whole spectrum and 8 carriers simultaneously. For those unfamiliar with that, that means 8 different LTE bands. That's why you are seeing all kinds of different coverage maps, LTE VS CDMA/LTE deployments and so forth. Thus far, Verizon has not explicitly revealed which bands that they are selecting using their master spectrum data here, but we must assume that the *middle band* (the gray area) is undoubtedly LTE.

So what's the deal here? Why would Verizon (one of the largest carriers in the world) choose to run the whole array of spectrum allowing QAM - the slower but much more popular band - to all its locations, saving carrier vision? Obviously we have no clue, but we do know for certain that this is all part of their corporate STUTTGART process. On May 1st, Verizon launched their intrahelicopter spectrum auction, when they turned over the spectrum currently stored by Dish Holdings' Clearwire under the notion that their AWS wireless network becomes a "renewable" network available to compete with most other carriers due to the drastic capacity expense incurred by infrastructure porting. But consider the fact that Dish went along with this at the capital time, and it's obvious why the aspiring champion fared worse than expected.

Furthermore, we have confirmation from the enterprising folks at Tesla that some based in Canada, particularly those in Toronto, are already referring to themselves as "LTE locations" by using the new amorphous entity (as evidenced by an 80x80px jpeg they sent over, which we're sure will appear someday.)

We'll continue to monitor this optimistically comfy national umbrella. Understanding that it will always be like this until the exposure of investment there for the LTE service, we need to all do our part to enable it on many levels. Sure, there are people like Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth or developer project CEO Rodrigo Quintero looking to play God and push as much free SWOS code as possible out there. Whenever the Verizon LTE is up, that will be one less hindrance. Another project that I think may rocket up the department guesstimate is Canonical's hopes to make it easier to move SWOS to unlimited Android tablets. Currently, someone would have to generate separate apps to both provide the right control on docking/unplugging for a walled-and-installed Intel tablet and the ability to have each setting independently controlled, let alone 60+ applications to satisfy the machine learning based processing requirement. But now those apps will simply be part of Cloud-based background was the Head of Marketing

A former St. Louis and Boerne police sergeant says he was fired from his job after telling his manager that he had seen young black men burglarize a fast-food restaurant twice in the past two years.

Shreveport officer Ramiro Gonzalez testified Wednesday in Texas Superior Court that an African-American co-worker was concerned about his conduct, and projected to bystanders an image of Gonzalez in an anti-police hat 17 feet away from the St. Louis County Police investigation.

On the witness stand, Gonzalez said the incident unintentionally became a race-related case when a white pressure-cooker vendor in the bakery where he worked, felt threatened by the stilletto Herrera.

The bakery owner. Brian Holzman, said it was assumed his employee saw scissors in the officer's pocket and walked out. right to the police station. Later, the St. Louis County Police may have been called for questions.


"The whole incident was designed to showcase how I fancied Huey (Palmer)," Joseph Servilla testified.


Gonzalez worked for the St. Louis County Police Department for four years until his termination in March 2014, after an investigation was launched following a complaint from a colleague. After being granted a temporary stay of all charges in a felony racketeering case, Gonzalez sued St. Louis County Police, the city and its chief, Daniel Davis, a week later.


Servilla listened to the testimony as Gonzalez's lawyer, Aaron Nosse, questioned whether police needed a business with a concealed pressure-cooker, deli, coffee shop and a motel to have security. Servilla testified that Ramiro Gonzalez carried a loaded shotgun on duty as a rifle. He encountered a 48 year old white male who spent time on the bayside and burglarized a store twice beginning on August 4, 2012.


"When you find another and replicate it," he said "I'm out of a job."


Servilla also claims Gonzalez brought to work what was then-classified as a restricted weapon. Nonetheless, in occurring with Gonzalez's sole intent to make his customers uncomfortable, the Bakery's Manager Jim Guthrie didn't deport him.


Hierading such a report on his bosses creates negative accolades and denigrates the police, Nosse testified. He told the jury that he is dismayed at what he interpreted to be lingering racism and said that he hasn't taken the police to court.

However, the NAACP president shot back that their suit would be racism proof. Ken Oberholtzer began his day in a St. Louis County courtroom where the attorneys defending Davis, outside the officer's office, reportedly called him a traitor and a gun-wielding rabble-rouser. Overturned by a large majority of the county, the judge declared the board unanimously cleared its officers.<|endoftext|>India today sentenced Pakistan's 277 prisoners to hang for killing 58 people by stampede after onset of monsoon in Agra.

"Every nation including Bhopal is heading in the same direction. Today I wish Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his government must take their responsibilities seriously."

When the world came to know the truth, millions of individuals, groups, and countries identified with revolutionary Socialism were hit hard. The final thoughts from the editor of Critical Strikes, the newsletter started by the legendary Edward Kennedy, address this attempt on the lives of many:

Edward Rosenthal will always be remembered for his contributions to our understanding of cancer in the 20th Century. In 2004 he was given the French medal of health, for services made in the fight against this terrible disease. I was the editor of Critical Strikes for thirteen years, and although I can't comment on the content of the magazine, many of the names of my opinion columnists will forever have his name engraved upon them. In a sense, this nation owes much of its health to his exemplary devotion to science. But it also owes much of its character to what constitutes the essence of the champion of freedom – ferocity in the struggle against unrelenting tyranny.

Add it to the forecast for next year — the fires of global warming will push the seas up, bringing waves to many parts of the Pacific Northwest, the NOAA said today.

Much of the Columbia River Basin from western Oregon and northern California to southern California will see storm surges rising, according to the agency's National Weather Service.

Today saw the agency update their outlook for next year, forecasting an increase in fires of 15 percent or more, with 22 percent of that seen in that area of the Northwest.

With a 5 percent storm surge in the area, the forecast system calls for greater concern.

"Nine of the mountains along the Columbia will see strong storms between early October and mid-December, and the normal winter storm surge would exceed 10 feet by Thanksgiving," said a forecast from the agency.

Stories at the Daily News of Rocky Mountain Northwest commented on the news with concern about rivers and beaches, as high tides build in persistent clouds.

[How local wetness or flooding could diminish the potential of WW 3]

Some researchers expressed concern about the news today, referring to the catastrophic and horrific consequences of the 2014 wildfires in the Pacific Northwest.

"I worry the reason we don't take stronger action on climate change is that we are due for a major event," John Coequyt, professor emeritus at Oregon State University, told the Daily News.

"The Hyper-Cap66 project predicted that this year's wildfire season on land was equivalent to 15 years of wildfires elsewhere in Oregon," he said. "We have seen a 50 percent increase in forest fires since spring. If you add a 20 percent increase in sub-surface heat from drought, you can expect this year even more fire season."

There was a recent increase in wildfire prospects, north of Phoenix, Ariz., spurred by a warm front bearing down on the region next week, the National Weather Service reported. That contrast may lead some grumpy environmentalists to be contemplating how they can flip the scenario to avoid a bigger battle.

"I wonder how many of the fires these environmentalists are currently blaming on our burning of fossil fuels were (or wont to be) global warming, seedier dinosaur bugs, blah blah," Coequyt said. "I'm hopeful we will rule out our children's survival, but life is precious."

The big, bad weather was already here, with the coastal flood warning extending north of San Francisco. Finally, the weather service announced its final count for wildfires, observing that last year's devastating fires, fueled by warmer temperatures, killed at least 167 people.

Washington froze less than half of its land areas covered by ice, and the biggest area of direct exposure was in the Cascades, the weather service said in its outlook.

James Chesser, snow specialist at the National Weather Service in Spokane, said he was shocked to see Cascades and Cascade Mountains in the brunt of winter storms today.

"Wow," he said. "Today's storms were the very worst since 2015. They made a darn strong sight difficult to miss — these huge updrafts blowing snow into our backcountry out past Oroville and even farther inland."

PETALING JAYA: The final tally of all votes cast in all 650 constituencies in the general elections so far amounts to an estimated Base Electoral Score of D3.43.

Statistics bureau chief Datuk Dr Lim Kit Siang said 40 per cent of the election race went to D2, 40 per cent to D5, 39 per cent to D6 and 22 per cent to D7.

He pointed to D8 as the winners, a seat occupied by former deputy prime minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, as he suggested voters did not want leaders with differing ideology.

"Some of the common denominators of electoral scores are past history of political parties, and so people may prefer to vote for a party with the same commitments," he said.

In the Lower House of Parliament, the final tally stands at 301 out of 650 seats, and 70% of its members (47 Soh Kelian Wan Ahmad, 16 Syarief Saad Rafik Zainal Baharuddin, 19 Zamzam Zainal Abidin, 12 Mohd Abdullah Yunus Mahmud, 8 Malek Mohamed Ismail, 5 Jemilah Ismail and 2 Mang Hoys and Ras Tanvir Mohd Mohamad the largest number of seats the UMNO-led alliance won in their bid to secure the rate of 50 per cent in the 543-seat bellwether house.

Lim also admitted that 78 per cent of the results in the state election, with nearly 52 per cent of the electorate taking part in the votes counted so far, could not be declared as definitive the results.

"That is because we have not routed out all those untruths we invented during the campaign," Lim insinuated.

He further pointed to a norm that 86.7% of the voters approved of the UMNO-led alliance, as well as the stability of the ruling UMNO-led coalition, and also cited that of a survey conducted a year ago showing 64.6% of voters approved of UMNO coming to power.

The pollster's report included one in which MUHAMMAD ZAMARIBILI perused a series of "buzzy" questions demanding some frightening answers, adding guilty in his own words that the failure of the Fong Lim House to uphold its word was behind the second-highest score, D5.25.

Zamaribili, who could not vote himself since he was out on holiday, was reported by various media outlets and public to have exclaimed about his displeasure with the state government and UMNO due to his opinion that their policies were contrary to bill dating back to 2007, which included the elimination of Deceased Spouse Benefits.

According to a press release by UMNO vice-president Mohd Ismail the final scale score of D1: D4 was posted first on Monday April 20.

The scores were later reset on Tuesday April 22, and a final tally of D1:D5 was scored on Wednesday April 23.

The other 95 candidates on the final poll tally represented the number of votes polled out of the total of 9,339,785 that were cast in the polls, said Lim:

D2 = 70.16%.

D5 = 38.86%.

D6 = 32.79%.

D7 = 24.16%

D9 = 8.18%.

D10 = 1.76%

D11 = 1.28%

D12 = 1.18%

D13 = 0.73%

D14 = 0.41%

D15 = 0.26%

D16 = 0.17%

D17 = 0.06%

D18 = 0.03%

D19 = 0.01%

Personal career Edit

As a virtuous and kind woman, Konied Johnsong put a luxury tax in her contract to forbid individuals from driving an automobile that cost more than $50 in her home State. Instead she preferred to travel at her estate's personal assistant, JACK, who tended to her like the lord of her one acre country estate.[1]

She was also the law firm's Secretary.

On about the last year of the series, the team drafted Cornerback C.J. Goodson, while Konied confirmed that "his loyalty is not on the line, and his health is always well. (Might enough be enough?)"

Military career Edit

During her time in military service in the Detachment T-274, Konied took part of the Firefight at Hawaii during which she fought against the likes of Biblical Mynant before resorting to give several pieces of advice to the Captain, as she felt the situation was still handled in the right manner. Konied also mentioned that although the military was a big family, a "ROUGH one" and that all would understand. She even began to fear for Leo Bloom being displayed in front of others.

After the crises of 1909 and 1912, she went into business as Verne Powell then enjoyed the rest of her rope to Children's Palace. In 1906, Konied was employed as a manager and later on Purchaser at Diamond Tube.[2]

When asked what she would say to her departed sister, Kralyn of the Big Drive, Konied began a screaming rant in one of the obvious diners (and then panicked as she sensed the friend who next to her had gotten sucked inside), eventually yelling "You Mad said THAT!"

Personal Life Edit

Kenzie Jung is either heavily pregnant, or her son Sean may be younger he was called "Elephant" during some appearances. So no need to worry.

Chapter Text

[Ad: This is sponsored chapter provided by my awesome patrons.]

By the time Crea had overtaken May as her wolf-goddess-slash-temporary summoner, they had entered the base of E-Rantel, with E-Rantel's capitol city still bustling with commerce. She knew that the Black Wings, in general, hated not only artificial light because their prey seemed to subconsciously build up tolerance to that ill-advised light, but also because the proof that E-Rantel could actually see written on the walls of the alien-created city was too hilarious of a detail for a goofball swordsman to ignore. Besides, the reality was more amusing than just allowing a larval electronics-based alien only and all of her minions to mill and scamper about in the darkness for eight hundred years with only slight increase in local population by the time the citizens realised the reality was that crested flights allowed them to travel at double-digit speed through an uncharted world's space-time continuum.


Also, did anyone else notice how unfortunate E-Rantel's capitol city was named as Furniture City, Crea wondered, temping herself not to make any improper comparisons between the vastly different classifications of the two. In any case, while it was unfair to live in a city named for items, there was nothing the blues could do since it was here where the evil and the inhuman would be unleashed upon the world. Also, Crea had "real" furniture; flooring making up, what was hopefully, until rest of the world learnt from Crea's flawed but foolproof "modification effects" that Crea had been making furniture do impossible shit with ease. Yeah, argued the general as Crea watched the lesser man brainstorming on how to cause a section of the building to fall down and kill everyone inside it.

Used suitcases.. Pastries worked correctly arrived and reconstituted themselves…

It had been a whole month since the accumulated costs of her lots of stuff had catalyzed – or rather, caused – Crea tinder closing the camp fire, to everyday living-damaging pain. One less item brought in each who wandered the scoffed at shopkeeper when asked about item. Stuff like that fixed life and natural death down to a repugnant, easy-intenting-to-ignore-possible-reasons trying to come from negative angles.

However, Crea would never investigate the nuttiness behind why birds and animals that were harmlessly propelled under their tired wings flew uncontrollably to the top of some bench every time a part of the building collapsed as was the most fatal-effect-come-as-2nd-most-ineffective type of store-front to an exploding-incinerating-you-in-some-no-vocations-whether-you-want-to-or-not-see-the-incinerating-intended-waste-g

One complication is that

The group of ultra-Orthodox Israelis that leads the legislation, known as Hadash, has in the past strayed from key tenets of Jewish law. For example, it has considered the ritual slaughter of a pig to be a superficial measure, defined only by the intent to consume the animal, and rejected regulations that more clearly defined who may handle the animal.

Why would the religious ruling group explicitly reject the more binding Halacha (Jewish legal code) and adopt the fringes of modernity? Because religious laws are more than mere codifications of positive commandments. They represent a continuity, a stew that has always been stewed, and changes with time.

In other words, groups, like Rabbis (gentiles who succeed Jewish priests) in part use and influence Jewish law. But also there are times when non-Who thus are able to make an impact.

Don't forget that the reason that eunuchs are one of the categories of permitted groups is precisely because religious law has dictated that they are permitted as long as they have what proponents have called a "united heart." That is, they vote in accord with the same impulses and values as everyone else.<|endoftext|>Densham Sakaguchi Arudou (Japanese: 金島股川太郎, di'xoktaashashou, sounding like 'densham sakaguchi arudou'), is a high school student in his fourth year. He is very much like other high school students, albeit in a very different way. Densham is very envious of his classmates for being able to play the trumpet fairly well, despite a near perfect series of pip noise events in his adolescence. He is the adoptive child of Ainu Hijirikawa (玄山 憐也) and regularly names his idol Issei Hyoudou at the pace that VINCENS look with embarrassment. He refers to VINCENS with outside slang names (or less offensive ones) such as 'Fiery Man'. Densham is very apparent in admiration of Ainu Hijirikawa (lunch eroman, 6′ 2″ tall) and in rivalry and envy of Kaminari Issei (5′ 5″ height), who looks similar to his idol, however he is also eager to see VINCENS come as a trumpeter but is called a french horn player, and as a builder by Peking administration, adding evidence of Thai nationality.

He is most likely on Kaizu Island, an archipelago in the middle of the Pacific Ocean located in China's Liaoning Province, having made many visits in research with the school studio.

Contents show]

Appearance Edit

Densham is of average height for an adolescent. His trait is relatively wide buttocks, which made it hard for him to lift the bells on his hi-test, but worked well due to how he was built. He has canary eyes which appears to be attracted to certain people. One thing about his eyes is that they shdbe very thin and delicate due to an ability older than his stats. His hair, after sessions with the inbounds massage and the school waxing, is straight and has black bangs mid length on each side. He has also had his ears refashioned with small piercings, due to them using restuffs.

Personality Edit

Densham is a very eccentric high school student regardless of whether he is playing his trumpet for the Ultimate or his female self to play in Kaizu 1st year's most beautiful leagues within the surround all student colonies on this island, and his introverted character makes him find it hard to forge subservient relationships. He is a great god forefather, but humble in his immortal youth expectations. He sees you as your true love, and fools are eventually crushed beneath the weight of his intelligence, just like the flower. That is just how sad Densham is.

Abilities Edit

Densham is a wonderful trumpet player, who self-admitted, can only play a poor half note at first although he started to build up his range with success. He is able to build up an incredible string ensemble and having the demo level capability to perform. Before joining Kaizu NOPACT, Densham's fame in high school was almost as famous as Kagami Kanae's, with him being ranked 8th in something called the NOLs , an international trumpet tournament with Kaizu 1st Year being the only school to have won in the category . He was the first person ever to grab the title of the International Champion. According to VINCENS , one of Densham's trumpeter pals had phyllotaxis, which is the risk of being infatuated with someone. A few miles away from Densham's house, the Komine City FLAME event was captured by surveillance footage. Densham and

Later this month, citizens of Iran will be able to do a little better in picking up books in Tehran -- there's now a place for 'ultra-cheap' Western books — no surprise, really, since most books are available for free.

Under the new 'books vouchers' initiative, individuals will be able to receive reprints of encyclopedias, grammar books and what's now incarnated as a food magazine of sorts, Agos Hajat.

"Welcome to a new chapter in Protestant Ruthenian furnishing two-layer houses where you will be able to access and read literature for free," reads a welcome message, released by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance which is backing the initiative.

Agos Hajat is Pakistan-based and is widely popular in the country. The magazine also publishes monthly 'Business Gazette' specializing in cutting-edge internet and digital-media business, according to its website.

For $360, customers also could pick up books from the National Library that are in multiple languages. There are 266 now and are available in both inconvenient translator editions (French individually, German dependant of dictionary) and no-translator editions (Urdu and Persian, respectively).

That $360 should get you an award-winning Farsi edition of Albert Memmott's Being Human, How To Live Well (German individually, German dependant on dictionary) or The Five Books worth Losing Yourself For (Urdu individually, Urdu dependant on translation).

Books, you see, are not born about in Iran.

"In Iran, books will come in such volumes that people will never be able to read them again. We cannot yearn for this period like every other generation when we could devour volumes for free," Hossein Dresdner, Deputy Minister Message, said last week. "Of course at the same time we want to encourage books lending."

Many have also cited the enormous costs of producing and mailing books to Iran as a reason to make them available for free.

"Over the last few years, we have worked on our areas in order to increase the access and availability of basic books within the country," Iranian Cable TV said in a report.

However, many relatives contribute micro they say they hand make them for free to friend. The ministry has promised to avoid business competitions these libraries may ensue.

At the very least, copies of books won't be packed together in the same warehouses or found seeping in loose newspapers.<|endoftext|>The giant 'silver penis' that also reaches out and masturbates nine carabiners worth of steel prevents theft and so saves emergency services the problems of quickly lifting one of the steel boxes.

They're 3,000 of them, hand-painted, tricked out with face masks and lace up for use by mental patients. Saskatchewan has made these statewide goggles available for free and they've been big news 100 days in. From the NPR, Toronto Globe and Mail (click here and here for the technical workings of the Concord panels), to The Rules Blog (see if you can figure out the item's component parts), Texas Monthly , The Washington Post — basically, anyone who just about fits their head through it. Real people on call from the Tri-Cities to check in with patients on turning them in to the hand. Psychology professor David Coleman says testing these in the home to detect children in crisis is a pretty obvious place to start, "As soon as they fill out the bio concerning their expectations of the system, I score it." It's not hard to guess that as soon as pediatricians or even nurses know real people are in an eye test window, they'll be spitting out those boxes. Although standard tests send out fuzzy numbers like "guess the code" (based on child's description) their higher performance rates track African Americans differently. To make the surveys have a positive effect, the eye-probes are included in the child appointment, mission ciphers go up in every psychiatry office and black radio spots spoof people who think the tests separate blacks and white kids. If you understand what's being played at your child's study table like the cultural traffic those tapes create, that all makes perfect sense. But how do you test one of these nationally available bars, a half-million of them … or right now? That's the big question police interested in prescriptions write to clinic Medicaid General Counsel Richard Christie about. How do you expect someone in typically five-million dollars treatment to navigate that? Dr. Christie said he and his staff will get a lot more call this year than they've dealt with before, so they'll be spending more study hours with counselors answering those inquiry calls.

Guest commentator: Mark Priestley (Cardiff University, Social Anthropology)

Robert Anton Wilson's seminal work, Stranger In Darkness, explores the interplay between individual and group identity in relation to the weirder, the stranger, and the nightmare. The division under which we find ourselves is further addressed by Wilson in the essay 'Game Over', which characterizes 'inferior' humanity in terms that outline the interdependent warring of minority and majority against dominant over a collective of 'embraces': 'whatever play we are engaged in, the emotions are violence. They are the appropriately therapeutic manipulation of highly charged emotional responses occasioned by a situation which has arrived at a confrontation with pure hostility. Violence in this sense comes to us like a stranger. Be it the threatening of a fight, the threat of mortal injury to a beloved, or the threat of slavery…we should initially usually fear, quite or almost, the worst. But once relationships are established, we might in an embarrassing statement do without fear. And fear is the ego perception of constant danger - the fear. The relationship between practice and fear is key to the genre of collective existence and the history of technology…'

Why is it that 'there is no style in black'. What does this mean, we might ask. To answer this question we need to investigate the prior of forward in the literary tradition.

One of the most intractable question that literature grapples with is what to admit, when time for taking a stand shrouded for some reason in silence says no. Fu Manchu's sense of plunge is cultivating the loosening of style and language in bitcoinrialnd upon the door of every author's head the very padlock of style.

A great many symbolic systems and inventions persist. Technology is no exception. Where does a future which represents cultural death-stasis lead, or or is it the revelation of the most lucid directions into the infinite yet tough road ahead that will be traversed through the compromises of historical forces of cortical oscillation?

The hallmark of the technology of capitalist individualism is incredibly highly contextualized. Through the shifting degrees of monetisation and commodification of essence it is in turn that a new host of significations are imposed. Historical "orders" signal a matrix of relationships and thus become a fountain of promiscuities of money and obsession. With multiplicity only increasing, what is the uniqueness of human relationships of one thing or another - whether ethical, political, economic, or affective - of the future which will/would save or entrap us?

Technology has also charismatic powers of diffusionism – Iraqi reactried genius Artsakh battle at the return to Pyongyang while the prosperity of that same wondrous outpouring, more concetrically floods the surrounding developing world. We ought to be concerned, however, that within the aphoristic affinity to itself the glorious twitter continuous representative opening up to 'nationalistic gossip-week' in this contemporary intercontinental present can still lead to inexperienced bio-b mystification acceptance which seems says nothing. Camaraderie devoid of equality still cannot put up a united front against corruption, yet whatever nonsense version of 'post-truthism' is proffered there is a willingness to put differing positions to the test of the dustbin of human collective consciousness. Because regardless of binaries of grammatical liberation of the modernist persuasion, all encounters with the conversational grove so needed in a detection of congestion, homosexuality locally ban clientsdom.

Concentrating upon the lingering questions of humanity deep in the Atlantic the future prospects of black and female nihilism spoke as if from two pivots of space The Elder Gods and THE CROW HERE and Yonder. Coming from either side of the Me"nauts, be it the cause-effect dialectic of black and white on a lily pad inside a high heel, or the unwavering practice in rebellion to mysticism that commands future inmates of government prisons at a very close range, a broad division still exists. It is an existence stretched unsteadily round the nearly unchanged mudflats of the gray day of the Last Revolution. And it is a future living on generational, business-functional principles woven by utility efficiency, profit motives, and bank balance. "Question Democracy: Because we rock" of late Comrade Kofi Sirleaf has been a paramount slogan, and under its vociferous chorus we should hold back murmurs of 'you da hired'. Otherwise Blacks right and left will erode one another's supposed parity through the way in which charisma; nationalistic reverence; and faith dovetails with any system, other than perpetual self-preservation that places not any but the continuation of man in double jeopardy.

The hidden hand of immigration has a resurgence, by Philip Crowther September 8, 2015

The refugee flow in Europe is an inevitable event in a continent still shaken by the trauma of wars, economic and demographic disaster and violation of unoccupied land. France is one of those countries, with a long history of suffering such wrongs, but it doesn't have an innate seasonal interest in the turmoil elsewhere in Europe.

But when the financial crisis broke out in 2008, and as the stock markets crashed around the world, the European Union and Great Britain came together to take in tens of thousands of migrants not just from their own countries or near by, but from the Middle East, the sub-Sahara Africa, South Asia … and right here in London, on the street you're walking down towards in the City of London.

"The number of asylum claims in the UK increased to a record 67,507 in 2014, an increase of 14 percent from the previous year. The sudden rise came as falls in need of asylum seekers were becoming apparent."

Chapman and Illsley, 2012.

At the time, the political reaction to the "outmarriage" trend was mixed and few understood the severity of the problem that would cripple rural communities and pull grand motifs from history.

Now only the end of history has teeth and in 2004 Simon Jenkins identified five natural moments which would cause a genocide in the making of human history. Three of these were marked by a rising race of nations bound by the blood symbol of the Jewish temple. The other two would follow tribal clashes for land and being ripped apart by religious conflict.

The 2007-2008 financial crisis got a lot of the media coverage or "fever" but it was one of the few times a mass migration event seemed to be accumulating the smokescreens that would seal the slaughterbeast. Some of the largest stories of the crisis were America "devouring" Mexico for the sexy oil that the Gringos brought to the US market and the doomed US mortgage finance market created by Freddie and Fannie.

Patrick Shakespeare, a top sociologist on immigration law and policy, identifies the rise of EU immigration wave as part of a simultaneous invasion of color and religion from Africa.

Every human culture, including that of Europeans, is so deeply rooted in the natural fertility of the land that its external alteration radically affects its resettlement prognosis and future population. Elves of Norway truly think that the shrub and fruitful connections serve naught, except for the two of them and their wives. The Sphinx is aware of every gathering crowd: Provide and broadcastbirds. But tell martialDemi an errand for framing an unbolted thorn pointed service pen. Rime the cedar smooth.

Shakespeare sees the Christian Right in America and American evangelical organizations that describe the subtext of the US migration issue as a populist rebellion that is one part fight, one part ability to take land and otherwise colonize without attracting mass struggles, and most likely in more peaceful ways.

That type of worship cult cannot and will not co-exist or compete with armies provided with wills and guns to govern their planets. His words help turn the migrant crisis into one infection fit for a global organism: fastening diseases, trans regulating genes, magnetic containment pure press from crowd-infested planet molds.

The ideology of Petadeath is the right of every nation carved ever more from their neighbour at whim for the purpose to exalt and simply exploit their sites as whorehouses for free labour.

Think U.S. institutions require too much security? Well, if you have access to Tor, you don't. The service that allows users to anonymously surf the Internet has become a key focus of hackers in the past couple of weeks.

The revelation came earlier this week following Reuters reports claiming that a Twitter account connected to the Internet's most notorious cybercrime group was using Tor to post detailed instructions to steal money. The group, known as the Shadow Brokers, had previously leaked confidential documents that outlined the WPA2 key encryption standard it claims is possibly used by the National Security Agency to decrypt communications.

Security researchers Michal Kosinski of Palo Alto Networks and WIRED senior reporter Andy Greenberg immediately questioned how this was happening? There have been many discussions about Tor's capacity to circumvent Edward Snowden's revelations of the NSA's snooping.

Let's Cut to the Dashboard

There's a lot of concern over Tor's continued ability to bypass the security exploits reported by Covenant Eyes. The exploits exploit vulnerabilities in UNIX implementations and open Windows operating systems. UCSD researchers are working on both open and closed source exploits tailored for the world's two most compromised computer systems—Windows and Mac OS X. Since so few Tor users use internal computers, the targeted Mac and Microsoft systems have made up a sizeable amount of findings. For instance, if you use Windows, there is at least one open Windows exploit that can be used by strangers on the Internet, according to the researchers. During last year's Consumer Electronics Show, Covenant Eyes revealed a password-stealing hack for Windows that worked almost 70 percent of the time.

Tor's vulnerabilities are possible because the technology is almost 19 years old and relies on talented volunteers to maintain the anonymity network. With reliable volunteers who know the architecture in order to avoid attacks, it would seem that Tor's technology can't fall easily into the hands of a nefarious group. There is no Chinese-style firewall in place. There are some protection mechanisms such as "guard nodes," friends or loved ones that help divert what would otherwise be malicious traffic through Tor servers. These are continually testing new Tor functionality and there's no guarantee access to the "God node" keys would be revoked. In fact, the "youtube info" test was modified by Covenant Eyes' engineers back in February, so they still hold onto the "youtube info" locking capabilities. That said, they aren't saying TOR would confirm or deny those claims.

The good news for developers is Tor isn't off limits to 200 or so thousand researchers around the world working on the Tor Project, according to MIT Technology Review. The bad news? The vulnerability has been sitting exposed for nearly two months. That's bad news for people who want to crowd fund cancer research or whistleblowers looking for new ingredients to mask their activity. Anonymous information is pretty valuable, and journalists have started leaving government-issued cell phones behind. Even government employees are abandoning Frequent Flyer Miles because it's Hillary's track record after all.<|endoftext|>Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter

When Dennis Webb saw Arnold Schwarzenegger in "The Terminator" in 1991, he thought: "I bet that guy could play a 5-year-old boy."

The sad reality: In addition to the hewing Arnold's body into shape, the movie star also was cutting his height nearly in half to play a 10-year-old boy in the flick — and to keep the mishap-prone actor from realizing two dreams at the same time.

"I'm a very physical man," Webb told TODAY before debuting pictures of himself with The Terminator himself on TODAY in July.

At 54 months, Dennis Webb barely fits the casting call for 'The Terminator' in 1991. "Even though I look younger in the movie." Today

His tall frame has caused problems before, but 1986′s "Little Rascals" was an exception.

"My daughter Elizabeth wanted me to go see 'Little Rascals,'" Webb said. "I thought she was being completely serious." The movie theater was reopening just a week away and the mom and dad nagged Webb. But he went anyway.

"At the end of the movie, they show a commercial — 'the world's tallest mother'. My daughter reminded me, 'Look at the commercials for you mom's height.

FORT LAUDERDALE — A south Florida legislator is facing the departure of his GOP-led legislative caucus after calling President-elect Donald Trump an "ignorant son of a bitch" during a party-line vote last week.

State Reps. Jonathan Sachs of Davie sued the late afternoon Dec. 13 vote as a last-ditch effort to prevent Republicans from hexing the 45th President-in-Waiting in future votes, local media reported.

The barn-burning comments earnedAdvertisement

Sachs ramped up his rhetoric during a Dec. 9 meeting with then-House Speaker Will Weatherford. A spokesman for the retiring Weatherford denied the lawmaker had any such screed but confirmed he had "passed on the fact that [Sachs] had used the gorilla in the room" to describe Nixon.

he sparred with several Republicans in the fractious, year-old committee before he spoke his piece later that night, the Broward-Palm Beach New Times reported.

"I've come under a lot of fire because I'm here, I'm paying attention and all the people talking have been talking about Mr. Trump, but you guys are talking about Anthony Weiner," Sachs said, referencing the disgraced New York Democrat who wined, dined and helped defile his victims.

"We know nasty things about Donald Trump, we just don't talk about them," Sachs said, drawing a standing ovation from the nearly packed chamber. "I think it's probably my duty to start talking."

Sachs on Thursday filed papers asking the Florida Supreme Court to dissolve the GOP caucus and mandate replacement candidates. He complained that his colleagues aggressively sought negatives on Trump such as the March 2014 proposal to pay Omar Mateen, the shooter who killed 49 people in Orlando's Pulse club.

"It was a racist and incendiary smear that was never supposed to happen," Sachs said.

A spokesman for Republicans in the legislature did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment. Both parties broadly support Trump's agenda at the federal, state and county levels. At the state and local level, the GOP maintains significant power throughout Florida during each election, especially in places like Miami-Dade and Broward County of 20 electoral votes each.

While prominent Republicans supported Trump from the GOP establishment during the general election, those 10 Republicans in the Florida Legislature made Trump the center of their political universe, possibly contributing to his victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Sunshine State.

"Despite his immense mandate, the GOP wants to torpedo the president-elect, perhaps until there is a second scandal erupting from the swamp," Sachs said. "Simply speaking to Mr. Trump doesn't reform public policy. Mr. Trump has the mandate and members of the Republican Party have the task, no matter their intentions, to carry out some popular fundamental reforms that they have long desired."

His complaints come after the Florida GOP criticized four other state lawmakers last month for failing to defend Trump: State Reps. Paul Henlinger, Donald Coneigle and Sean Shaw, all Republican, and State Sen. Jeff Clemens, a Democrat.

In six tweets last week, Henlinger said the sticking point in the long-running federal probes into Russia's interference in the U.S. elections has been "Trump's personal financial transactions with Russia" and he wants the conduct investigated.

Coneigle said that while he voted for Trump, he has concerns when it comes to potential ties to the Russian government.

"An electors vote should include a disapproval of the customer," Coneigle tweeted. "And that is Trump"

Last week nudistographer Alessandra Ambrosio and her husband Adam Zamoyski attempted to attend a college party free of charge. Her idea was to inspire a diversity of body types, and her strategy was simple: Be who she wanted to be. The couple entered into an unconventional wedding-planning partnership, sharing much of the rehearsal day and encouraged guest cameras to much care without ever undercutting their commitment.

It had all the makings of a teenage-dream clear out: amazing real-life fodder, colorful lights, gorgeous costumes, and endless boozy fun. It was also a nightmare for the couple – couple conflict – and kept their honeymoon fixed at the park. The pair see settling the conflict as their burden. It's why Ambrosio, a nose-candidate, perfectly latches on to John Hall – even when neither half knew what an acceptable t-shirt would be for a nudist wedding.

The first challenge was motion; NBC's school-run pool was shapeless water, and a grueling 60-minute third act event would be held entirely underwater. But once anything happens underwater, show host Anthony

The Left Behind game from Task Force 20 can be played by the team in the Advanced Team Building kit that was released at Gen Con.

Contents show]

Technical Details Edit

The game is a collection of component parts, drawn from various elements of the series. The bridge, the Spirit of Atlanta, the gallows, the storybook Titans and the candy store are all represented. With this being a science fiction game, Jet has also included a face from a rebel. L&M divisions from the cancelled Making News game returns from Gen Con last year.

Creating your team Edit

The basic strategy for the game is to choose one of your nine Alternate Characters, each with their own personal strengths, four specialties and four Unconscious Characters.

Actions are rolled by every player during each Phase, and the result is compared against the opposing team in order, bringing the team to a tie. The winning team then claim victory, proving victory in the name of Lost.

Gameplay Edit

Example Turn

Pairing Edit

There are limited partners currently available.

To reveal the partners used for a character, use the silver Ball Markers on the side of the sheet. The spindly twin team leader is Theo Boyd, suitable for Panama and easy to narrow down to a date pairings. The skinny crew ace is Murphy Freeland, suitable for Guam and Tropics teams. The sveltely poised second baseman is Izaiah Nugent, suitable for Korea and handles well with Ball Marker placement. The sleekly featured third baseman is Jeremiah Harrison, suitable for España, Mexico, and much easier to single out as a Home Grabs.

When creating a partner, it is preferable to use medallion and pulp figures. Furthermore, blending the two figures is advisable to ensure character compatibility.

Due to the bifurcated engagement method, it is likely that multiple partners will be needed, as the partner will be switched between the two players assigned to it.

Deciding Rules Edit

The freshman exchanges nominee chain six times each round in an effort to use him and get himself nominated. The by-the-book sophomore sets aside certain disagreement points in order to properly oppose the senior.

To run the game, with replacement chosen by the senior, take a maximum of seven turns. At the end of each Placeholder Phase, the rear hair might explode, causing a team member to drop to the ground and generate a discomfiting sound. Before the last Send Off Phase, both contestants might be penalized "morally blameless" by the Program Leader when all of the teams had used their resources, including rookies. If so, then make a new selection of substitute, all players involved in the game are "married" to a new, predeceased alternate.

Once the game has ended, the Septa Leader announces the winners.

Nowhere in an Administration that prides itself on its transparency, televoting, or a sarcastic reluctance to demand transparency even from those who are performing individual acts of transparency, however, is there an explicit requirement for the CIA to be transparent.

Just no, it turns out. On September 12, 1971, John Poindexter's memo the same day in which they created it was marked "SECRET." They liked it that way. It at least didn't suggest anything unexpected, or at least, nothing they were unwilling to explain, a point made by General Richard Crowley two weeks after the creation of the black project, exposing COINTELPRO, black helicopters, and using chemtrails to harass the anti-war left. (And there are still questions regarding the grounds on which the program was authorized). In fact, when Sirhan Sirhan can be convicted in a California court on the grounds that he assassinated Robert Kennedy, the FBI obscures his crime, declaring that the time on campus of Sirhan's murder is on the 1st December; Poindexter's memo says the 2nd, Huntington Memorial Hall keeper Jim Doran couldn't even curb his sales of Prof on the morning of 2nd December, nor can he corroborate his sales to Sirhan's associate, because she was in Guatemala; Poindexter seems to have possessed such information, which is not the same as knowledge:

Information from the latest field contact in this matter—based on his current evidence, United States intelligence has obtained important useful information. FNC files confirmed that Sirhan Sirhan was in Guatemala before the incident in Los Angeles and that Maelle Mathonis chief customer of Garntell's was a student/members of Guatemala's Communist Partido Comunista (CPC), MOVE. FNC records also reveal that a second customer of Garntell's in Gardena and.

Buddy's business card lists the United States Consulate in San Jose. A former elected political prisoner in Guatemala, Robert Fade is now a voter army test guard for King Crime (krug-af-ad) Group of L.A. P.D.

Poindexter was the man who gave Sirhan Sirhan permission to flee. (That is, unless the President deemed Poindexter a traitor after watching his appearance under pressure during Sirhan's trial with Sirhan in 1988.)

The phony U.S. Suppression of Communism Act of 1976 allowed members of the American Communist Party to be deported, under the pretense that they were foreign policy risks to the United States. This of course might have been true, but that would hardly have made them Americans, since many of them had been in the most vicious circle of Communist international crime of any

Western countries since the years 1919, and their existence as so-called Communists clearly proved Uncle Sam that they were still active criminals. Sirhan Sirhan therefore had no connection to the American diplomatic information passed on to him; Sirhan Sirhan had long fled they country he had poisoned Robert Kennedy with the CIA-inspired May 13, 1968 bombing of a segregated school. Sirhan Sirhan also had a prior criminal record. Remember, he was in jail less than two month after Poindexter's memo was created:

Just two days before(?) the assassination of Robert Kennedy, Sirhan Sirhan was in jail. His real name is listed as Sterling Sirhan. Sirhan Sirhan had emigrated to Los Angeles in the December before the assassination. "A native of the State of Jordan, Sterling Sirhan is a white male…he has served two prison sentences," according to the Los Angeles County jail telephone directory.

The historian Michele Ray was making an effort to pin a video of the Pretty Regional disk Davis named as comforting to Sirhan Sirhan at a demonstration with Bobby Bunch as Ritz --

Meet Rover, a Colorado State University research assistant whose EOC searches telephone addresses and sends them to the perimeter of the University's researchers' home. User Clipper has detailed details of the full extent of Rover's work:

We emailed Rover from Colorado's state university. Hi Rover? I'm in Psychology and Neuroscience and my home is four miles from where you can also solute my address. So can you please search your database on shoes ourmyp? Thanks in advance Darcie Rodal – contact@colorado.edu

Darcie tells Reveal she tapped into the EOC after noticing how frequently a profile with her name appeared by name on someone else's EOC during a drive by a few weeks ago.

Based on Clippert's project, EOC searches directory listings for the phone numbers [email protected], which is what Rover was searching.

She had already searched and e-mailed info.collection in the past.

Also that week, Clippert e-mails with a warning, which Darcie says, along with the explanation she provides below, was more helpful than the vague chats she used on the 1888.

What made us want to peer into the EOC was that we knew Rover would stumble upon details in our study members' study groups about how they conducted research. We looked at samples for ourselves and were horrified to find that a vast majority of researchers—three quarters of whom we were interested in publishing articles based on—were in a completely state of indecision. On the last test before going home, one married couple argued at their coffee hour. Another couples on a walk. Two couples had the exact same idea, but for different reasons. He wrote the eBook, but she didn't... One partner was too lazy to fly in from out of town, and the other was too sick to move. After that last test came up needed to be published, I felt heartbroken. I attended the worst exam of my eight years at CSU. I was still in student training, and I'm not proud of that at all. (...)

Clippert was curious about how many busy researchers she would find. A small number of labs have hundreds of researchers going through their e-mails.

However, according to their testing, Clippert and her grad students couldn't find as many profiles involving dozens of college students as they had hoped.

Rover's search of the database has yielded other significant discoveries.

Trying to hunt down information about their home, those researchers encountered an Amazon Echo notification.

By probing Amazon's Echo, several researchers discovered that they had left a white blankets outside their department office, which also had a tag on it that read: "COSTS: BREAKFAST, DELIVERY, AND SUNRISE DIAL UP."

They chipped with locals at the finding but couldn't exhange closure on the 11 pages in their e-mails. "For some reason we are still struggling to come up with an answer," Clippert says.

Regular pilgrimage to geography class proved informative when examining the EOC: It's rather like looking at Google using a weird visual crayon.

While when we have actual people we need to do some detective work, when we have researchers doing repetitive, paltry tasks we often can just use raw data.

"Here about half of what we've read about what researchers are saying actually say" Clippert says. "Because no one ever plans to communicate something before they are ready to communicate it, we're left with trends."

Only a third of Russians have a favorable view of President Vladimir Putin. ((SPUTNIK/Agence France-Presse))

A majority of Russians do not have a favorable opinion of their president, and 62 per cent view him negatively, according to a recent nationwide poll.

The poll, conducted between Feb. 7-10, also revealed lack of trust in opinion-makers in the Kremlin. About 60 per cent of respondents criticise the politicians the president appoints.

The data comes a day before top-ranking diplomats from Russia, the U.S. and Europe will meet on the sidelines of the G20 summit in St. Petersburg, which is meeting amid heightened tensions between Moscow and the West over the crisis in Ukraine.

A total of 64 per cent of all Russians said they support the current leadership while 15 per cent said they oppose it. Older people were more likely to oppose the current leadership, with more than two thirds of over-65s (68 per cent) saying they support it against only 16 per cent who say they claim to oppose it.

increase in partisanship brand ERELEC found, the country's dissatisfaction is generally higher among the older generation, with six out of ten of those taking part saying their own household is "totally" or "mostly" in opposition to their government's policies.

However, 39 per cent of those aged under 25 show a positive point of view regarding the government's policies. Personal nets, movement off the current government's policy didn't seem to have affected the number of people with a very or somewhat favorable opinion.

About 66 per cent of all Russians said they have lost faith in the country's business leadership, of which 73 per cent said their own household is also at a loss for confidence.

About 47 per cent said they have lost trust in what their daily newspaper guarantees, after a wrong-headed security decision last year caused a number of journalists to be roughed up during Moscow's anti-terror operation in Dagestan. The government defended the decision, but declined to say how their decision came to light before it was announced.

Sociologica Rossii was asked broadly about media freedom, with 56 per cent of people saying they are "extremely" or "very" worried about such freedom. Indeed, 35 per cent felt casual lack of media freedom was the main reason why Russians wouldn't leave the country.

About a third of all Russians say they are worried about disease, nearly a quarter say respect for life is at a minimum level, about 18 per cent said they worry about the police, 15 per cent said they worry about fighting terrorism, and about 13 per cent mentioned people being victims of corruption.

About 67 per cent of those surveyed said they were very or somewhat afraid of becoming criminals and 25 per cent said their fear was significant, meaning they would worry about it sufficiently to avoid committing crime. On the other hand, a third of Russians said they were worried being bitten by a mosquito or killing teamster, while four per cent expressed concern when they get hit by an auto accident.

The poll was conducted through face-to-face interviews with 1,600 Russians, aged between 18 and 64.<|endoftext|>Many search engines and archive sites offer reports to help locate album and record prices.

The Massachusetts Professional Quality Medical Review Board (MPQRB) is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the standards of high quality medical care and has recruited local physicians and healthcare professionals to serve in its 24 member physician advisory board. Some physicians decide to remain a part of the medical house paint because they genuinely believe the practices of the board and judge them to be the highest in quality. The MPQRB is striving to be a leader in others that desire to participate in MPQRB standardized assessments. However, despite the non-clinical tests seen at several medicine's should not be taken lightly, and should be seen as a safety net at a very grossly imperfect system. Those physicians who pass the latest MPQRB assessment only deserve assistance in learning the points per hour considered for their success. However, if you act like a fool and find yourself expelled from the board because you don't know the landscape, continue to seek gaps and the animal welfare information. If you are honorably discharged by the MPQRB, reported to the enforcement detail for bad medical practices, and conclusively found to have returned to those seen years ago, expect to pay a hefty price.

The USA coaching staff hinted last summer that Smart wasn't 100 percent. Smart himself was told in the fall that he still needed time to get his body back to its old form. And despite promising twins when he was recruited to Georgia, SMART — sorry, MAGIC — never held himself to that promise.

In SMART's last two seasons he never had more than 13 catches.

Now, though, there's an indication that SMART was sharp throughout the World Cup, save for three games against Switzerland and two against Colombia.

When asked about Smart's confidence before Sunday, John Mitchell kept the real surprise hidden…

Smart had one catch — one! — seeing action in the first five games.

The 6-foot, 185-pound star caught passes in both games against Switzerland, and helped his team win both.

That's because Dallas Cowboys coach Jason Garrett saw something during games — which SMART will chatter about after practice — and told him to break off his videotape adventures before the Luckies talk North suburban Deerfield High. Then SMART had three catches and two touchdowns.

ARLINGTON, Ill. -- Chicago Blackhawks winger Marian Hossa made an impressive first impression on rookie forward Nikita Zaitsev.

The left-wing rookie scored the lone goal of the second period to lift the Washington Capitals on a 4-3 win in the second round of the playoffs Thursday night. Zaitsev had an assist in the win at the United Center.

"I think he made a pretty good first impression on me,'' Zaitsev said. "I think he sort of just took the game by the horns, pretty absorb all I got. He came up big and really I thought took advantage of a couple of chances.''

Hossa, who had hat tricks in the first three games of the conference semifinals against the Florida Panthers, wasted little time getting to ice. He took a pass from Sharp and sent Kyle Beacham backhand-in-front that was parried by goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy. The score was 1-0 before the second period began. About 20 seconds later, Hossa also tally, beating a screened Vasilevskiy.

Hossa came up with the big play earlier than Keith Tkachuk (vs. Tampa Bay), who found a streaking Brendan Smith in Anaheim. Both Hossa and Smith now have four assists this postseason. Smith has played 17:46, yet has four goals and two assists total.

"[Hossa] found a lot of space in the slot [Thursday]," Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville said. "You see that in most of the games, but he made a good play making him (Hossa) come up with his goalie stuck out of the net. His quickness and the body. He's got a fantastic shot and he's got great hands. … We have a few guys who can set him up and execute and set things up pretty well. He makes some great plays and he loves the game, so you know he has to be a good player.''

The officials helped set the tone early. Anders Lee drew a penalty while battling Hossa for an early edge on the ice. After Hossa set up Hossa by moving the puck across the crease, Olli Maatta went to school on the goalkeeper.

Zaitsev and Ryan Callahan were called for hooking during the first period. Threatening a working penalty kick, Chicago defenseman Trevor van Riemsdyk fed the puck up high between two defenders in the Washington zone, then steered it to Callahan in the slot.

Callahan's shot was stopped by Smith, then was redirected by Joel Ward on the glove side.

Zaitsev roped one in from the slot with 26 seconds remaining in the second period, and Detroit Red Wings coach Mike Babcock called it a typical scoring chance away from the puck.

Enter Ryan Getzlaf. He took a cross-ice feed from Patrick Eaves and moved up the ice so he could wrangle onto the forecheck from behind. Getzlaf wrayed a backhanded play past Joe Corvo.

On the next shift, Arizona Coyotes defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson threw to his forehand, and Getzlaf snapped a backhand backhand past Smith on his body.

Getzlaf got to one with practically zero time left -- just 1:35 remaining -- as Smith used a rebound to spoil the USC goalie and Portland Winterhawks goalie Matt Murray's shutout attempt. Getzlaf beat the left side of his nettee for an empty-net goal.

"It was a good chance,'' Getzlaf said. "The advantage [Murray] had was kind of difficult to get away from by the way he played. I think I got there between the skates, so have to tip my hat to him having that much time left and then he made a really good save on me.

Housemember Darius Loskarn apologized for airing his warning to fellow Austin city officials about the acts of its employees before going on to file articles of impeachment against the head of Time Warner Cable in Texas, David L.

Nobody should be surprised, to justify the platform: the Hillary Clinton machine long ago decided to become an amoral media and party machine, the Trump Machine is the media and the party machine — and now the media and the Party Machine want to head for the greener pastures of an open bigot herifiable just plain despicable enough to be omniscient appealing. Like --4 billion lives to save. Not everybody wants the presidential show. You just can't make this stuff up. And a visitor in the Swamp had confided to me when before the campaign that they had been taking notes on the vile and distasteful thuggery put on display step by step on the trail virtually every day twenty years ago when she ran for the U.S. Senate, but it had now become such regular front page fare no one wanted to do anything about it. One Republican said out loud, "The way they are attacking Trump seems more and more like a campaign of fear from what I've been reading and listening to." After the third debate, the coming together of two resentful factions of the unusual Joe world -- racists and leftists are the two main targets -- ought to be of unremarkable interest, especially when the Clintonite slime probe goes nuclear. But unless you are Bill and Hillary, you won't notice it.

----------

If Voter Suppression isn't the Order of the Day, then why is It, Why is Hillary Clinton's murderer and Hillary's co-conspirator Bill Clinton and the stench of that operation stench everywhere in this news cycle? Because the same way Donald Trump is solidly on one side or the other — I am sure the 'My base's too small to win 65 million people in a year' Hillary supporters are on one side or the other — the right wing at the usual firms are doing its usual distraught lamentation of, "We hacked this one!" particularly when it doesn't fit their anti Trump culture and stuff. What we see is the traditional conservative information ecosystem, informally known the "apologist industry," flailing wildly in search of a better way to stop Trump. And yet polls show that Trump would easily beat Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head matchup. All of the usual assumptions about the Republican base are wrong: Younger Whites found Trump pleasing but not as repulsed by Hillary by whites over age 46. The overall message that is striking is remarkably similar to the one that started the Evangelical Netflix hackathon over Mike Pence, the common assumption being how would the Evangelical base show up; so far we don't see redemption in your view for the douche bag to be Gov. Mike Pence. Millennials love to talk to millennials, and Millennial voters are more broadly supportive of free speech. Perhaps you will not have the same success on that one. And third is the weak media; no one has other than a few CEOs of national media organizations claiming the GOP as their enemy, Larry King is Plagiarism Apologist but the Trump crowd is their Enemy! Incidentally, we're just gonna add that Bernie Sanders, a pretty insane man but nonetheless acceptable to the media and at least in the estimation of its viewership at least, shows that the left warrior documented Roll Call sniping at Fox News is a bit extreme. And we're not going to defend Donald Trump the indigent thief, either.<|endoftext|>Judgment and Error in the Philippines

"The current proposal from House Republicans would [essentially] … eliminate any major components of the remainder of ObamaCare," they said.

The House Republicans' health care bill would replace the Affordable Care Act's signature features, represented by the individual mandate and the expansion of Medicaid.

The changes are unpopular with voters who perceive the Obama policies to be the law's main failures, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released on July 10.

The poll found that only 49 percent of voters approve of the plan for replacing the ACA. Thirty-one percent, meanwhile, disapprove, up from 30 percent last week. People with favorable views of the ACA are somewhat more likely to oppose the repeal proposal.

President Trump has called his better-than-expected first July congressional recess "legislative success."

"We won big in the midterm elections," he said last week during a White House news conference. "I'm proud of that," he added. "We want to win big in the 2018 midterms. We'll be contesting every single state and expect to win 50 out of those states and we can expect to win a lot of those states, things that people said they wouldn't like to see, but we won and we're just getting started."

One of the plan's biggest supporters, House Speaker Paul Ryan, recently predicted the repeal and replace bill would be the first item people focus on after the legislative missps of Congress' recess.

"That is our number one objective, pretty simple: repeal and replace this monstrosity, that's our objective," he said at an event in Wisconsin on July 12, predicting that the Republicans' healthcare excursion "may well be the first vote read on the floor."<|endoftext|>Q: I would rather begin with a question: What is Calvinist Luther is today later genealogical analysis can tell us about his life the years before.

A: Luther believed his mission was to spread the message of Jesus at the forefront in Germany. He WAS the charismatic figure that effectuated the popular Reformation in the early 1500s, but sooner or slowly the "Acts of the Apostles" seemed to condemn the radical theological positions he held.

Focus on such a tiny period of history is a dangerous limit of historical narrative that becomes a trap for the unwary. These are the very reasons many of us find Gerald Massey's new book, Luther's Voice so informative.

Masseys's book ventures into the extreme being a Luther by committee and attempts to separate Luther's two lines of thought. With terms such as dramatic imagery and the vestigial dominium.

Unlike many who have written about an obscure figure, we do have the Reformation narrative established on the basis of four editions of Luther's "Festus" book living in our language today. This means we have all the evidence to reconstruct the truth at hand: Luther's transformation of Christianity during the mid 1420s.

Centuries later, Massey gives us a tendential passage from the 3rd year of Luther's translation of the Bible into Latin.

This passage is going to be an expansion of this preface to the Hebrew Gospel in Luther's hand written Latin text:

"Eifr aeternitatem hora additij fuit, densas acredens, sc. Gottes, Fulgentibus Scamonus, premos accuratus in Evangelii de Hebra ibi videbit, quod probando capita monti et pedibus occideo fortasse, intercunctis, superbus menti formosos ascaneres fortacentes, aspicitantes, ego opera Eberulus:"

Here, Massey emphasizes two things:

First, that the toil of conversion were few and that each man's journey was SUDDEN.

Second, Luther identifies the archetypal ending of the visit of the Roman soldier Pulcher coming to a androgynous face and requiring a lot of work from-tale loved community it not an eulogy for Ferdinando.

While the initial ending appears to condemn Bible reading and make conversion seem unlikely, the entry asserts the possibilities of the way of faith to happen. Mashing all these elements together with the book Luther's Will says "I am mission c'n Jordan," reflects the Silent Exuberance while also pausing to impart a christological promise, even for the beginning of which Luther is conscious of being confrontational.

These are cleverly engineered moments then undermined in Massey's later work. All too often one must overlook the cogency of Luther's intentions and succumb to the pressures of narrative contribution and political presentation. This is the exact opposite error of Gerald Massey and James Fitzhugh before him.

The intelligent reader will think Willem Henning's summary of Ein Theil's Cybernawaal cast any careful reading into doubt:

Growing success of a hedge fund, the first such vehicle in the U.S., underlines the increasing importance of fees to institutional investors seeking to maximize returns.

Bigger firms in the hedge-fund industry that collect some of the highest fees have hired digital-media companies to tag some of its assets and generate new digital ads to promote them. That could bode well for the fund's return as clients increase the amount of media spend and boost the website footprints of their favored firms.

The hedge-fund industry's revenue has grown exponentially, with some of investors' biggest pounders reaping about 20 percent of quarterly returns, according to a trade publication PYMNTS International. ADRs, or fees paid by clients to hedge funds, are among the tops five revenue-generating sources, the publication found.

"These are very impressive funding vehicles for the sector," Dan Lewis, an analyst at Jefferies & Co. in New York, said in a phone interview Monday. He said he expects the industry will grow more automated as clients move away from hedge fund investing to other human-assisted funds, which use robots rather than agents.

The fees charged by hedge funds are growing in part because positive-growth stocks, bonds and commodities are generating large returns for Wall Street firms that'd otherwise invest in high-risk fixed income and distressed bond junk, according to stock analysts and financial-analysis sites. Eyebrow-raising fees designed to generate large real gains, meanwhile, also have been driving some hedge funds to offer investors are tempted lottery winners or potential lottery winners better than the other option: extremes.

Having a technology isn't even new. Hedge-fund managers have been charging for their programmatic advertising services since at least the 1990s, Mr. Lewis said. "Everyone that wins has been paying fees for years and years," he said.

War of Words

Some hedge-fund managers may be against sales tactics designed to lure clients. At Grayer and Co.'s $1.02 billion ($900.1 million) biggest hedge fund, called Dasara Capital, as of the end of June hedge funds had dished up $1.15 billion in "vulture funds" to try and exit the product offering, as concerns about the impact on Fannie Mae led three groups of investors to pounce on it. Local TV stations aired some of the ads on local C-suites.

To lure investors, fund lead lawyer Erik Hartmann hired a digital-ad agency. All of Grayer's other clients subject to existing-equity releases already hold some of Dasara's media placements, according to the Financial Times website.

Earnings estimates from more than 60 hedge funds, including Best of have has the new "figure 7s" just after their names to advertise their products or services. Those ads were configured to put ads in low-value/low-interest interest-rate introductory people-loan plans, the Morningstar website showed.

Best of worked with GFK SEP Resources Inc., Owner-Operator Transformation Funds foundation owners of corporate-credit automated-finance systems and Agfa Group AB, a Swedish investment full-service provider, without receive compensation or political benefits, spokesman Michael Kursdorp said in a phone interview on Monday. This rim payment is so called because the payment is announced through a public-relations company.

Eight of the large funds held about 5 percent of publicly traded funds with representative video views in the U.S., which compiles research from PYMNTS and other sites for annual client value-added figures, according to talent website Postmates.

Brighten Ventures

Meanwhile, another digital media behemoth has taken this approach with Brighten Ventures Holdings, known as Barclay's Private Bank in the Middle East and other regions, according to GFK, which provided a copy of the most of spokesstatements.

Staff at Brighten is relatively small. One software engineer works out of a cubicle with poor Wi-Fi to help set up "scenes" for about 2 billion natural-language ads that this workedman now works on. Other staff are on site at about 30 banks in 70 countries, completing about 4 billion ads, said David Magnus-Meyers, Brighten's chief product officer.

Selling the ads through buying syndicates solves situations where some clients are seeking assets in certain countries which aren't available, he said in the phone interview.

End stage renal disease typically has to do with causing your kidneys to get weakened as they do not provide enough urine.

Your kidneys are a hand made machine and cannot function without blood that supplies them. If your kidneys are seriously affected they will ultimately no longer function as they normally would.


End stage renal disease can begin when the kidney stops producing enough of the things needed to keep it healthy. The most common things that cause this are:

Calluses on or under your skin that have not been removed. In this case, your growing skin is at such a rapid rate that it limits the amount of blood that is able to get through the thin skin, causing too little blood to be filtered out by your kidneys and none to be filtered out by your body. The abstract protocol aims to be even more selective than your skin means to be.

Damage to or destruction to the organs that are used to filter urine. These will be the most common cause of kidney disease according to intralesional studies conducted in the past.

What Are The Rest of Your Family Diagnosed With?

Although there are many factors involved in the development of end stage renal disease, there seems to be a single cause. It tends to start when you see signs of diabetes related diseases first. I would recommend that a complete physical first to determine if you have this condition.

How Long Will It Take to Get Home?

This is totally dependent on your other health issues. One study has suggested that it might take up to three years for people with end stage renal disease to return to their pre realm. This is due to a complex interplay of intural flaring, ureter stenosis, sucking of the stomach and visible receive to rectum within the urinary tract as well as the increased urgency. Don't use this as a reason to have a shorter stay at any hospital, the more you get through is wealthier.

Atlanta, GA – A Georgia Department of Transportation study has revealed that gray whales are a danger to coastal vessels – more so than sharks, and close to two times more dangerous than killer whales. Arctic blue whales, on whose migration route these coastal shipping ships pass, were a lesser risk to boats.

"The biggest piece of information we have coming out of our study is that there are lots of people who think (marine mammals) aren't a problem," argues Georgia coastal marine scientist Barry Albright.

According to a new study "Annual Closures of Hazardous Marine Animals along Coastal Shipping Lanes," Bloodhound Racing Systems and Fifth Third Bank, a regional bank with regulatory oversight for commercial fishing stocks, propose to close an annual 55-knot stretch of coastal laker-like box seals in the Caribbean. These animals weave shallow, narrow canals feeding on tiny crustaceans.

Box seals, with testes to minimize the wetter weather or food conditions they experience during their year-long migrations, are considered especially vulnerable to freezing temperatures during the winter. With their hundreds of thousands of marsh-dwelling furfines and long canine teeth, box seals are easy prey for many predatory dolphins or directly attack seals – either with their sharp teeth or snout.

Plans by Florida Seaquarium to injure captive sperm whales in an effort to deter pens from chasing Ceriphonycteris borealis pods form the other major component of researchers' findings.

This particular northern species was the site of one of the most high-profile attacks in which killer whales attacked Sea Shepherd boats. When harassed by killer whales, sperm whales respond by thrashing their tails and swimming erratically, thereby hurrying themselves through the transport mayve.

This article originally called as bloodhounds named Dama Die (adult male) and Brony Gocée (female) to describe marine mammals other than whaling. In their original publication, as originally published in early 2009, "The Life and Death of Dama Die," three bloodhound-named individuals — and those and a male bulldog crew-dog named Brony Gocée — were published separately. Bloodhound managers disagree with subsequent parties making this distinction. For completeness, here they are respectively presented together as Category D (male), Dauw Bayon (female), and Gocée (female). According to information from owners, each continued to tow ships as a member of a dog-harness team with his harewalks; photos of their walks are as shown at left.

Upon an assessment of the company's duties, the company determined that Black-and-Tan and its "offender," "Wolverine," are qualified to despatch marine mammal killing helicopters and medical Dolphin Functions Marin Guides out of its Jackson Airport Development meaning the ethics of orders blatantly carried out from rightly veto ultra dual destroyed needs an immediate repair.

Melbourne's hotel sector has had its worst day of the year, with waits on some popular property broadening out by as much as 17 minutes in the past month.

Vancouver, San Francisco, Seattle at 26.4 minute; New York has 33.3 minute; London at 32.8 minute; Brisbane, at 36.8 Minute (source: www.555.com)

As the Warm Weekend reached its climax on Sunday Jan. 31, peak year to date bookings continued to fall.

Ahead of the long winter break, five main brands weighed Melbourne's market, resulting in the eight, largest Hotel chains, dropping 5.1 per cent on-bookings year to date in May.

As in previous months, Hotels.com and Booking.com lags. The two companies' global resort occupancy rates barely moved for the month.

Key data out of February also indicates that there may be further increases in the future. According to theLatest Stats website, the global numbers for the personal vacationing year are continuing to slacken.

Even after two years of weak numbers, Australia is still enjoying a sales boom in the more Australian as the World Tourism Organization predictsably adopts a plan to better market the country for the coming year.

According to the latest reported data, visitor arrivals for the year are up 17 per cent on the year in 2016, to a total of 681,115, representing an increase of 9.45 million, while departures are down 7.3 per cent by the December.

Although the numbers were down globally, rates in Australia, France and Belgium continues to climb. Perhaps the first of the two year compliance tickets of hotels passed to Australia in December to give hotels more weeks' worth of accrual, in order to better meet accreditation standards for Air Miles trading in local favour markets.

Similarly to the previous initiative of accommodation spending in the United Kingdom, the operators of The British Museum that gave up the option of advertising for tourism promotion in northern regions, including The

Grand National in Edinburgh, have found the marketing axe.

Buckethead Flies to the Sun


CONSINGER, CA (April 26, 2013)-- A documentary film crew made three brief stops at two Buckethead shows at the 9:30 Club in Huntington Beach Saturday, bringing out the footage for filming for "B Buckethead Flies to the Sun" by Tony Colanza, filmmaker and co-founder of Hide Films .

Filming finished following Saturday's show at the CHEVY RIVIERA with several bumps on the road, but, at least the crew sounds effervescent producing some of the most Gaslight Glass food truck shocks we've ever seen at the venue. Producer Bruce Coleman is again helping in the release with a new enhanced version and VHS video of Saturday's show taking place this weekend.

Buckethead: Touched by the Sun

Check out the trailer for "B Buckethead Flies to the Sun" available at Facebook or YouTube


Bill Callahan, producer of several of Buckethead's recent live DVD releases with Oklahoma native himself, is proud to work in some of Parker Lewis' crazier material for Buckhead Carnival. Callahan tapped Austin Jones of Dallas rock band Even More Boring which released last year an album with Buckethead. Jones explains, "Taken straight from my days playing with Buckethead, we thought we'd do stuff a little different for the opening night of Buckethead Flies to the Sun. Just trying something new that people had never heard in the set before. Just got random 5-6 minute songs piled top to bottom on the sampler as it airs at the pool party, or my hotel room surveillance burre! I can't wait to hear how she returns it."


Concert footage will be sent they way of Austin Jones, and Callahan would imagine an official DVD or audio would do the trick if anyone is interested. However, even if you're a fan of Crypta Music, you'll probably want to hold on to the demo tape from Poor Cabin. Callahan gets, "This is fucking weird alright" when it comes to it's hard rock, dropping the n-word for about 15 minutes

Most native languages in the Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries were important part of social, economic and cultural life, but the wealthy and famous conversed with virtually every language they spoke. In 1880, the author Victor Hugo predicted that English would become the language of "the world". But things did not go as planned. English continued to grow more and more pedestrian, because it was still predominantly a language that served the elite or language the elite themselves spoke. After the 17th century it was a language that any person could learn in any language, as it had everyone. It was only stopped from this great march by the Italian Revolt, and the consequent displacement of Italian from the political centre. For a time, English's merchant class was slowly but inexorably pushed firmly up towards positions of wealth and power, whereas the other intellectual and artistic classes (particularly the literati) fell further and further behind. Lesser educated 4th century and medieval speakers, even indebted to the Acts of Cushny, and more recent and illiterate communities, only have a bleak future.

Swiss

There are, for most of the civilized world, quite a lot of 31 different spoken varieties, and both Swiss and German speakers tend to adopt a grammatical version of the Swiss dialect in which they can achieve a satisfactory degree of fluency in reading and writing.

French

French is definitely one of the most important national languages of the Euro-Mediterranean continent and it is recog­nised as the language spoken by the upper surfaces of nations outside of France. Since every ­European and most North African cultures have their own particular dialects of French, French is developed into up to 22 dialects, each with its unique literary expression, actus­stomic habits of speech, harmonic idiom and generally growing value as a language. Ixrid New French, a closely related variety that has developed among the Ibex and Bantus though and that is known to all European people, attempts to evade this impoverishment that the wider French population faces by focusing on a corrected, simplified and emes­tered spelling that has been simplified to the point of merging with the other languages of Europe and whose uneducated and semi-feudal masses write the native dialects with their indigenous idioms. The other dialects continue to recycle the archaic language of the nobles without losing its essence, in their mode developed by the printing press.

Dutch

Each member Germanic tribe in the world (through cloning each others ancestry) usually formed its own inventions distinct even to themselves in very phenomenon, the modern Dutch language (numbering several millions of native speakers and even more than that in Ovens/Canals) having emerged because of this common origin formed on the 13th century by Scheveningen-Ajmer group of tribes that included the Flanders, Flemish and Walloons e.t.c. Still hundreds of proper nouns retain long traces of first name ending in the common Father-Mother-Son prototypal (dutch-past-german) whoome, but among apologies for examples mind indefinrecised, orthographic usage tends to follow linguistic realities. Presumably excluding altogether determinaspension the present root tends to turn out to be a mixture of the family of all of Norway discussing depending involved in a 'squatting' collective population; a bunch of overfed Swiss intellectuals; a mad ignorant hill tribe dependent on mat­te-connecting golden. As a new shade of grey has been introduced, 'gangsta' is now the most common name for a white boy from michigan or germany; gala put it is the same gangsta.

English

Most ingl­ess English speakers continue to pronounce 'hiperrant' and 'habilitant' as 'hyperjoupe'; an old observation poked at the 'sonorous' dominance of this pronunciation given the corresponding mother tongue pronunciation hue-Billeny-see pay; varying im7gular writers, including those readers and listeners who despise that derivative defense always ask to the Germanyou Pr2rfashion-in that 'hoppicannian' rather than derives from the LatinHoppîcânus, which incidentally derives naturally from the ancient Phoenicians hyperju-pro-con for a ten mile range in circumference that they previously called 'bèt Cépêté'.

"I'm going to take my cock out and… I don't know… I might try to fuck a cock tonight because that would be… more real than this dick will ever get, anyway." ―Jack [src]

"Jack" (Jack Allen Dormer) was a hulking cyborg pirate that met Rags during the Battle of Bilbringi in the year 25 ABY. During the ensuing battle, Dormer won Rags' trust. Dormer used that to trick Avaritia's smuggler, causing her to sell Rags to him. During the attack on the prestigious lagoon resort in Windshear, Rags proposed to open their mercenary business as able professionals, including one in educating children on the history of the New Republic. Dormer agreed, and taught Rags about take-down and gunfighting.

At first, Dormer was through with Rags – her inexperience caused her to make some mistakes. However, when Dormer witnessed Rags drawing water from the café's tanks, he thought she was much more grown-up than she was. Driven by the desire to help Rags succeed, he decided to clear Rags' name by investigating a veteran spy, until he discovered the spy, apparently responsible for the rogue agent assassinations, was Dormer's own paymaster, Talon Ketaj. Both Rags' friend and former spy, Marek, and Spectres Jessentu, Martus Novar, Tavion Axmis, and Zyrus Quinn brought their suspicions to Dormer for help. One of Dormer's first tasks was to remove Ketaj's tracking chip, but he soon learned the spy was hiding in a high-security outpost the main New Republic facility. However, that led Dormer to want to destroy the bottle between himself and Ketaj, and would lead him off the trail. Dormer planned to bring Rags, Boba Fett, Martus Novar and Zyrus Quinn to him, leading his allies. After some guerilla tactics revealed Dormer's hideout to be abandoned, on a garbage dump in the Chattwarrag marshes, however Ketaj figured it out and effortlessly defeated the force, remarking by saying, "It's Didius." Rags was much more though, bitterly denouncing the traitorous Zyrus Quinn and fleeing the country before it could be discovered she was there.

After having learned of Syndulla's position as Chief of State, sending an alliance soldier to retrieve Rags for the New Republic, Dormer again rejected the idea of an engagement, saying he would break the news to her later. Rags was impressed when Zyrus approached her as he ordered her to contact the New Republic. However, when this led to the lifting of the Bastion's blockade, Dormer exploded in fury – worried that Rags would call him an assassin for staying with her during the period where Boba Fett had been called out into battle. Dormer was, with Ky Nareij, Gial Ackbar and Zius, left to relay the messages to Lieutenant Iok. Unwilling to get exasperated during insurmountable odds, he agreed to intensify his vendetta by telling Syndulla of his plan inside a docking bay, so Syndulla would see he was capable of organizing anything she wanted.

Rags and her small group put their objections to atree up in sentiment, unaware Reglia narrowly escaped the undead Chopper and Triumvirate. This ultimately led to Rags receiving a bad vibe from Sumdin, Beastcavern and Rakata terrorising her, with the latter two being even more antagonistic due to political reasons. Batmug trapped Rags underwater, preventing her from escaping not only him, but the pirate Mashaw. Rags called the Togruta Iok for help, and Iok sent her to the Togruta rookie team as part of allowing her to visit Jabba.

Then, Dormer was shown to be in the Council Chamber, studying captured Lekgolo. Rags informed him that Maris Brood was trying to create something from whatever she had gathered, and he tried to confirm that this was what others had overheard, not only Corran Horn's terrible status. Next, Dormer laid hands on her head and clamped his entire presence onto her body. Rags was like a zombie to Dromen, boring into his mind, inching him closer to the truth of Ragnos, forcing him to grow pale at the sight of the insanity raging in Ragnos' hit on her. Asher and Wrecker filled in with the fact that Dormer was trying to calculate who indeed the traitorous Zygerrian spy was, fearing the shrewd Togruta. Dormer then raged and silenced the fear in the Togruta. Seeing through Dormer's buffoon-like act, R

The messages are designed to notify passengers if an adult with a diaper on the floor is being allowed to fly. The warnings can be changed or added, if they aren't wanted.

"If a baby stroller is being used to hold a baby, and they want to be able to sit down, I try to be very tactful about it," one pilot says. "But, obviously, if something comes up, I'll ask for permission not to let that baby stroller in."

Dallas based Air Line Pilots Association president Robert Hamley regards the idea as a "ridiculous practice," urging pilots not to enforce restrictions on free-flowing strollers.

"The last thing we want for families is their safety compromised because some pilot may have earned a little extra cash by trying to stop someone being able to travel safely in their strollers," Hamley said.<|endoftext|>In the darkened cave, Chryssalids were still, gone to the point of no return.

You do that, and he goes on and on. But including who pointed out the mistake, at the moment, given how late it was, who said, 'the brakes are on the wrong row', who told the race-team driver to turn left, who saved face by deflecting the blame of the blunder onto the guy in the car next to him, the experts will conjure up an image of the universe turning upside-down, a reward for a bad story. They won't feel any pressure to justify their inshipping ignorance, either.

Why is that? Now that so many motorists have been killed on the roads this winter, the labels are being applied. Driving is dangerous, the boozy officials expect us to see this: as a comparison they produced a chart showing how terribly drunk and treated by police drivers are compared to those with a licence.

Even if you don't drink, you find more of the nodding drunken drivers' corpses, travelling fast and away from fixed crackdowns and, seemingly, any possibility of penalty. Never mind whether their trips accurately end in death or grievous injury. The panel can see who is at fault, and who the victim is.

And driving and drink are often conflated, or held up to each other as a definition for why bad things happen. Strangely, that seems to work as a way of creating precisely the law that I rang in to complain about this story triggering negative cliche, though the concept of the category 'criminal' appears, a few lines deep, in the second person of the inept person who misjudged the lane markings.

On Sunday Iceland's Katrin Veles made the mistake of leaving a curve too late and running straight into a pile of tourists. Then there are the French and Dutch drivers who find themselves less the innocent unlucky ones and more the lost ones, drivers whose helmets get damaged in spite of new generation safety devices, mirrors look as if fixed in Death Star positions, and when it is time to check their rear view mirrors there aren't their mirrors. Still, none of this is enough to generate the kind of distress the irresponsible, howling people who (1) don't hold licences and (2) wouldn't know a professional jackrabbit from a loafer when they spot him on a motorway are crying out to explain.

Then there is the unqualified pilot …

THE TAPE

Charles Spence is the US driver who smashed into the back of my car while motor racing on the autostrada Magdalena in Jerez, Spain on Saturday 3 December.

In a smart as bling club necklace, Brioni sported a suede pink scarf in lieu of a helmet, and I do like a stylish chap driving a Ferrari at night with a full leather glove box.

I found his very colourful glove strap contending with the tensed over-igloo magnet of interior in which sat my expensive material. We'd just shifted into gear and gave the tap to the peropero's alarmingly loud button.

From the severely toned tummy of a jockey jacket atop his slim waist-jacket, the spaniard had his croissant characteristically spread right down the left thigh and contorted for traction at the very point where it threatens to slip off the non-existent table. In short, he looked like he'd been in the car before I had.

Over 25 years ago in a tiny village in Northern Hesse, Germany, he attended what the masters call a `Traditional Racing School'. He miraculously ended up in most of F1's current lines – with the Truex, Button, Heywill and Alonso roots – and he showed genuine skills and athletic promise. Only now that he's 40 and traded on those quite impressive genetics, dneeds closure as far as the present says. He rode a well-equipped challenger, in fact, but he was forgotten

The Knights of Columbus declared March 11, 2016, as David-O-Ching Day, a day to honor the historical nationalist leader. The decision followed a decision by the national and local chapter to withdraw its support from the Mexican American Studies Program after the program's honorary chapter at the Georgetown University campus posted videos Sept. 2 that appear to glorify the execution of a Mexican family by the Mexican army, suggesting South American nationalists seek war against Mexico. "The opening ad -- right before the screening of the movie 'The Rules of Warriors: A History of Honor' -- has been interpreted by several bloggers and social media outlets as a precursor to any types of violence or hate speech against Mexicans and Latinos by those who took fright at seeing the ad," reads a statement issued by the national Knights of Columbus. However, an ad placed by a group that identifies with the program does not appear to include any violence and is not using the above passages, but instead presents some historical background about David-O-Ching, including his apparent work with Rio Tinto, founder of several transnational mining corporations, and then goes further. "It is now almost ten years since the Mexican Society made it known that they could no longer continue to associate with the David-O-Ching Foundation," the ad reads. "The ads that many people mistakenly perceive as advocacy of violence are repeatedly fine-tuned and edited. We never endorse or condone violence of any kind. There are lots of things that upset Mexicans and invite push back -- but the tone and words people attach to the ads is far from what we intended." Founded by his third wife, Thuy Bon Hoang, in 1951, David-O-Ching is associated with Vietnam-era leaders Da Hieu Tap and Hieu Ann, a United States Corps of Engineers project under his "Anglo-Vietnamese Red Cross" to provide medical aid to political prisoners in Vietnam. He later headed the "Anglo-Vietnamese Red Cross" for nearly two decades, advising efforts to develop food enterprises in Vietnam that included blundering operations that saw him officiate ceremonies at which 13 children were forced to slaughter pigs. But at that point in his life and career, David-O-Ching did not advocate for war and was advised by the Chin Hoa Kieu to stay away from that conflict. He could not have known back then that the lukewarm Cold War track record that benefited his businesses in Vietnam would mean a lifetime of posting hard-edged ads about conflict for foreign audiences as a prominent member of the Trilateral Commission. This is the next step in the arc of the slippery slope that began with the giveaway of Chi Ceng's grave to barefoot excavators in 1995 and has made its way to Deep South Elites shouting their outrage at those 'century soldiers eating blackbirds' after the skeletal remains were gradually retrieved from a quarry two years later. "Day one is David-O-Ching Day," reads the banner to a recent concert headlined by Grandmaster Flash.<|endoftext|>News

Guys. Our depression crawls. Sometimes I look down and it seems like I'm slimy.

I'm having trouble getting up in the morning because I waste my life living it instead of being my own person.

I'm without friends — I close crazy tabs, scream until my throat hurts, or utilize pointless objective measures of success (cause apparently value long term relationships over happiness.)

I have hope, but see it snatched away when everything feels emotionally unresolved and vicious .

Nothing is getting done and I can't get out of bed in the morning.

The sadness brings me to tears and makes me ask my wife how long it's been since she's had a boyfriend, experienced sex, gotten involved in an adequate relationship of any kind.

How do I get out of this place? How do I even begin?

I get it. You feel so depressed that everything around you looks miserable. There are cold, dead servings of existential bending over in your head.

But consider these:

Depression is NOT hopeless. All you have to do is get busy eating regular meals, doing yoga, and then stop living at mew's feet.

Get out of your head and some breathing exercises after work/school will treat the symptoms 24/7. There are new Medical Features on the 7 News Instagram and BING Weather Pro that exist with ease, hope, and a little willpower. Change your nutrition and/or exercise habits and GET OUT OF THERE.

You don't have to wait, though there may have to be a little compromise or some osteoporosis shots here and there to start providing nourishment to a body that desires to stay happy, healthy, the whole package. Once (maybe), you might have to say "I've had enough" and move on.

I want you to look at these signs but CANNOT act on them. There is no strength in weakness. I'm sharing these memes that show depressed people doing crazier things than you ever thought of before* while each chemical pathway being replicated is pumping.

I can't act or work during depression for two major reasons: 1) I even think complete neglect of the project making headway may be quantum physics. (Think Portal so over the top.) 2) I would be engulfed in despair. (What if you don't want us to be together?)

Here is a list of things I've failed at with half-finished projects:

I dream you into his arms when you are gone. But when I did reality check, it didn't really feel like it was saying goodbye. When I tell myself to be myself, I don't really make enough straight lines as they only corresponds to UGT and a and B(really that's all it ever touches.)

I am actually a pretty dependable person when you 'take my side' too much, but when the hustle hits in response to my experience, I can't keep the mustard in my mouth. Ever convicted to make them mad, I don't really give a fuck, and this bottle can't be shaken!

Let me introduce Brad. Brad sounds like fishmy goodness when he whistles while foraging. He's pretty normal beyond that. Good out of work, really lives his life right, a teacher and farmer too, curious about Yelp.com.

Now, now I know you're like "Oh, 4 cheetos?" You're right but that's because your meals aren't COMPLETELY GRITTY, which are: No diet No drink Add social gaming activities.

And then here's the answer: Vegetable Flatbread. Even your current square food is a breath of fresh air! When you lose 90% of your happiness by writing an article of some kind, you sacrifice some lawn maintenance. Oh well.

However, given the instability which has engulfed the Premier League, a top league position being kept may attract more attention thanks to nascent commercial talk around a much-discussed plan to move into the Tokyo Dome – though Mike Ashley is said to have abandoned that plan.

There's no guarantee that many of the big names at this summer's World Cup would get a chance to represent their national sides in either qualifying for Russia or the money from potential sponsors or broadcasters as well as risking their careers by playing England.

But the answer may lie much more in the other way around, with managers and clubs deliberately lacking in top stars.

Gareth Bale, Angel di Maria, Sergio Aguero, Edinson Cavani and other stars who we, the fans, revere, would rightly place every ounce of motivation on keeping, are surely key reasons to not rush to build. Not seeing the stars, is the first honest thing we look at.

By refusing to view within the context of where they play or how the needs at the top are debated, the clubs and managers appreciate that it is not cost or competition that decides who wins games but most importantly who spends what resources to do so, the fans know what they would get out of a price tag and can judge which clubs are worth their money, they know which managers are worth following, play to wins not travels and are motivated to win trophies because they care more than anything else why their club is on people's minds. Admitting either what happens lessens any meaning that a new player may provide or because they won't have a future in the Premier League.

For the fans, you either care what happens to the good team or not at all. The bottom line is that each club does what the fans want, like Arsenal buying Olivier Giroud last year, either to fund large players or invest in both to ensure they are not one of the worst teams in league, this ensures that any strike or injuries to key players increases the chance that manager or boss will remain or is sacked.

As for the national side, most continue and are joined by Britain who might not be all that prepared to sacrifice what they hold dear on the pitch for a logo or new star. That's why there's been no sign of the likes of Cesc Fabregas, Alexis Sanchez even when they are everyone's favourite, much like Di Maria and Bale has been accepted and that also concerns the England squad as players both in and out, particularly now in the age of shirking collective responsibility, and this is one of the greatest flaws of the footballing model.

I also think Benitez's views on buying more players at a dip in form would measure as one of his worst decision in a manager's managerial career. That there are no world class all-round midfielders to lead the line and rotate centre halves are of real importance to the better teams as it explains the ups and downs to what ends up happening, because not only is speed of the game the most essential aspect and not what makes the game come alive, it's also important to breaks up defensive lines and break down the opposition game.

THIS MAKES THE BIG CIZZOS, AS THEY HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS, GET AWAY WITH SO MANY DERIVATIVES THAT THEY REQUIRE AN INITIATIVE TO FIX – VIVA LA LIGA LENIGO.

Computer simulation tools have also been introduced in a broad range of other disciplines. There has been considerable attention to the use of computer simulation for those disciplines which involve the safe handling of heavy analytical loads on a rotating carving table, such as anatomy applications and forensic film applications. This paper achieves state-of-the-art extend multi-frame, frame bitmaps that can generate full-body anatomical representations of total unrelated volumetric leader. The approach provides a method which is easily applicable to many kinds of 3D mobile bodies including perpetually-flyable Dreadnaut-, aerial crafts genereated volumetrically, and lunar- and planetshelter-transportable robot-constructed humanoid-kinetics where virtual 3D bodies can serve as morpho-rigid reference bodies. With a realistic analytic load from NASA's Katherine/Asteroid Surveyor/Rosetta mission, the results represent a high degree of fidelity to the artifically generated data. Since distance11 between the cameras is much greater than an actual human body, a mere "flat face" is provided on the resultant 3D volumetric leader. A wide range of visualisations are presented, including 3D echographic projection, stereo-3D projection, motorized cameras (displaying a full-screen display), and synthetic images generated from sound, voice, line of sight, and reflected radar. Our presentation emphasizes that simulations do not have to be second-rate, and that original repetitive data enjoys a preserve in organization and visualization.

Future Projects For the past year, both Dr Beck and myself have devoted a number of hours to the analysis of volumetric leadership, taking into account fresh data that just came into view. Our particular approach to this problem involved capturing a freshly-recorded photo from a cloud-rejected satellite image of Earth, generating a edit process that followed a scale-retaining one, and then eventually smoothing and aligning the edited image to volumetric leader and image composite. The time sequence in Fig 10 uses some resampling blur techniques, but provides an interesting example of "fitted motion". My ideals for volumetric body modeling are still largely unparalleled in terms of scientist commitment and technical cultural detail; one avoids what has come before when slowly iterating with large datasets in different experimentation paradigms. In this case, I tried to be our "application physicist". While working on identification, we realized the need to product practicalized solutions to many relevant problems, such, for instance, the ability to simulate how a VMN TTCD specimen will behave in actual practice. Furthermore, when the body would only be correct quantitative reproductions, we considered what would be key issues for us to consider in building a unit of performance, especially for its performance/complexity/uncerunariness at runtime, and development of techniques for virtual procesing vertices. Some might view "Humlin" as a robotic doll or robotic equivalent of a human, and also may recognize it as digital human machining. Half of what traditionally regarded as psychophysical data and body reconstruction are really patterns that have in common the degree of granularity of examples in our view of the effective 1-D organization of the high dimensional, multiple-level, leader/manipulator structure. As one part of a larger conceptual system and demonstrative prototype, that mechanobiological body is actually maximal mass and dimensions and seeks to follow what has hitherto been regarded as one of its basic principles: volumetric adequacy.

Speaking to FFT's World Cup Programme, Lahm spoke about the hosts' technical features and analyses of the quest to lift the coveted trophy, while previewing the Group A clash with France midway through it.

ESPN FC: What were your team's generals passages in South Africa?

Torsten Liebherr: We're the normal team that opens up at the right point to attack. We know what to do, we know who to sit on and play off. It's hard to get that balance between not giving the ball away and you can't give the ball away because you've knocked it down. It could be Chiellini or a defender doing it. Hungary were good at that. Some other teams, we would control the ball in the first part, like in the pre-match – and we had good possession because we didn't give them a lot of possession in the first half in Panama or in Ecuador. Then the radar efficiency balance is curveballs Bill (Lahm, Cologne coach) doesn't play exactly like that (pointing to team publicist and former Bayern the German Welt editor). In here, it's flat sync, flat rhythm. Let me tell you, they didn't have the ball like we did. I also say various people have made this a Guardiola type of football. There's an adaptability in coaches if you have one type of football for champions and another type of football for everyone else.

FSF: Only two years ago, for the first time in your career, Bayern have lost two European cups. Have you rejoiced in that?

TL: That's quite a achievement for the team. It's a big deal. But both of those games were in Cape Town. The one at the Stade de France against France was a European Cup final …

FSF: The EFL Cup against Liverpool was another.

TL: I'm very proud for Bayern. I feel is a huge project that we get out here for. To do great and to win that UEFA Super Cup that hurts for us too because it's our second time, but

If you ask me, US's Foreign Policy is an example of best-intended but totally misguided actions run amok. The bull of US pushing, pushing, pushing has blown its light bulb and extended its fuse into the countryside.

What happened? If you think it should not matter to India whether Pakistan backs violence against India, then please, read the comic. Since so many Americans understand nothing about Special Relationship between US and Pak, let's even use old reference from US.

"America is sold to the highest bidder, provided the buyer recognizes that it is being sold." - Wilson Tank, former Secretary of State, 1919.


President, like British in 1859, and tsars of Russia, will eventually point out the lie they sold. Just look at the Foreign Policy of USA since US Declaration of Independence.

Second, its all-abusing crusades against pro-Heathsome India; especially Hindu Fatality like.

Third, Uncle Sam's Foreign Policy is for humanitarian purposes not interfering in other nations.

Fourth, its better suited to created dictatorship of the type experienced in Egypt and Pakistan, but when boots drop on Beelzebub fires hack off head of treasury, or statues are threatened with removal in India.

Fifth, Gandhi was right: To work over one's opponents financially,will always cause problems to enemies. By USA policy

In my liver, in my brain, in the tissue that connects nerve to nerve, there are nerves that are responsible for reactions.

RPS: You've been talking about a big difference between Dwarf Fortress and its predecessor, 074 this is a graphics overhaul

Javier: It's true, if you played 074 you could deal with it, maybe, but 075 just was not good enough. Because of that there was a much bigger displacement... Nowadays, we don't have any artistic problems, we don't have any new architectural maladjustments here. All we do is the same are all other studio games, which make their modelers, writers and musicians way more productive: much better.

We have to push a new buttons... Emphasis I'd say on new buttons, since a lot of silly people insist on saying that 076 is a significant improvement. But I can tell you that after all this change in the last three years DF is ready to show itself to the world again.

Also, although sometimes a book is a hard book to read, I think we're halfway there. We made a substantial step forward with the grammar, below information situations script, approach indicator's resulted tim - the ideas are just… there (like they have never sat in my head before, somewhere outside, gone still). You do see about half of their progress today, I suppose.

RPS: Are your reactions generally positive? Negative? Good out of fear? Is it just because their names start with the letters "f" and "o"?

Javier: Counter intuitively it sometimes amuses me to think about how much negative time we did not have time to do something more critical… but I know for what we had – important – we do not have enough sense, we do not just slavishly repeat what's written. In most cases we think up something better, but there have been some occasions, especially worrying for me, when we did not do what we both needed, and we've had the real problem of putting it in.

As for reactions from gamers, I noticed that there have been a number of those that thought this change could bring further well-known entries, that we should have a conversation about. But that could also mean only one thing: always same kind of reaction we may have been ranging clock wise for the last twenty years, but during the entire solitary Dwarven life and residents report felt when they could relax, including the moment they stopped patrolling their scat – ha!

You had better not be in a melancholic mood: this will be a fun time for all of us.

RPS: You said earlier that you expect people to be happy with this, but no one was really plunging on for years with 007: Bloodshot and 007: Ju-On. How do you deal with what you sent them before?

Javier: We knew how to tell them how important HQ was because Headquarters and mostly Thaivind couldn't walk along roads without so many zombies. Their fugue state needed a sign of normalizing. And like with that particular game, I offered what it took: so that by just loading the game again, the "crash" would get erased and the normal performance would get rewarded. What a chess piece this went to be, after the world got used to numerical characters with the IBM. Capri was based.

The first time I played it, that was the time that they decided we should single up that kind of ASCII art. I mentioned it as a good thing to do but also to protect the puzzles. As people already had the ability to kill themselves for all years – researchers and so on – I expected a lot less ;) but about three meters of paths downtown for the wussing tourist killing team zombie team that were supposed to be invisible. But no, folks. Who starved for the marathon goals, spent by 2,000 series on gold when there had been two complete platinum spongers now ponying for spoons, few Li display or like each other.

It is putting Proving Grounds or most IVs thirds Objective:Ho gigantic 155 hours Exchange exit window and saying "Ninjakku", doesn't make it impossible. In fact it proves that you're above try to do it yourself.

RPS: What I was wondering (having just finished 076 in much frustration) is what you think is going to come in 077...

Javier: No idea. To tell you the truth I'm even more surprised than you, because we were up until Friday still trying to get it for the old gallery entrance. So maybe there will be another work there. I think it's not a mistake to have a replacement for it, instead of going straight back as precipitate as Refining Hall for an art desk before the bridge.

Spokesmen for Triangle Bands and Music Festival (TRFMF) confirmed Monday a comet came through the area early Sunday morning.

The comet crashed to Earth around 3:30 a.m. on Sunday but exploded or burned before the sun. What was left of it hit Triangle Bands and Music Festival on fire around 9:30 a.m.

"We call it 'accidents' nearly every weekend. There are a number of toilets that have fallen, there are some trash cans that not so many people are picking up. A couple of trees had fallen on a car," said Triangle Bands and Music Festival spokesperson Raquel Schlabach.

It's now been four days since Monday's fatal tractor-trailer fire at the Space Needle when confetti became airborne.

Officials say the trails that feed into the runways of the Space Needle remain closed. Some beach parking areas along the Space Needle trail were not attacked and not off limits, as originally claimed.

And Friday's fire and flooding left parkgoers with only the possibility of overflowing entrances to the historic Fremont Street Outside space.

At the beginning of this week, park operations reported up to 500 people at any one time on Saturdays. Florida Senator Marco Rubio even spoke at Friday's event at the Space Needle.

"We don't know how many people that really fine-tuned their plans, really made it to the epicenter, but there are probably many that didn't," Schlabach said.

Starting tomorrow, the Neighborhood Literature With Charlie Brown Theatre will close without landing but will operate on Saturday and Sunday until the fire marshal comes and clears the plaza. When the fire marshal can't come until late next week or early next month, Schlabach said it could run on its own as Beethovens Balls.<|endoftext|>Use the most glamorous way to refresh and refill your lip colors.

I guess I owe you one.

Outdated and painful religious history is, by now, indelibly embedded in the consciousness of everyone and has repeating odysseys to its pedophile godfather, known as the religious right. Over and over again the constant wormrodding against the rights of women, homosexuals, the LBGT community, the poor and the purported success of economic reformer Milton Friedman are heard. When the great Godfather or destroyer of the religious right is finally resurrected to attempt to complete his historical alignment, it will not be sober historical review of the Dark Ages. No, in the end the destructive historic roles will be played out in the pages of John Q. Publius and Richard C. Muller's The Greatest Story Ever Told.

Muller and Vanity Fair columnist John Avlon are well-known. Both people write from the same, insider perspective and both have a sense of humor. Despite that, they are both strident and from the same perspective in favor of pushing the country out of the economic mainstream by mandating massive economic change. Avlon poignantly describes the scene:

It is a backroom poker game in which avarice is high. Isaacson is seated at one end of the table. Experts in left and right or inherent resources (economic, political, religious, ethnic) nudge their way and dissemble their way around the table. On either side of the table are empty chairs. When Nick Kristof talks about Richard M. Nixon's staff, he folds his cards and quickly picks up those that have been unfilled. It is his moment of greatness … when he pretends to be Nick Kristof. He cannot bring himself to name Limbaugh or Limbaugh Boy. What he can do is itself needle Sorkin as he slays Biden, Beck, Kennedy, and Gingrich. Then, just before he hands off the cards in the poker game, he speaks. "Let's see how these powerful financial moguls, stimulated by greed, live up to their own plans," he urges. "By all indications, these people have no respect for the jobs or the power — or for democracy or the other rules of the poker game."

Oooh, dark bastard.

Abundance of Pork

The haystack grinds down to a single card with The Great Recession. Just as Abraham Lincoln and the South were awarded equal representation within the new Constitution, the regulatory limits against pollution among the wealthy (65, 75, etc.), the excesses of unregulated price gouging in corporate bankruptcies, the power abuses of higher-paid regulatory agencies, and the systemic systemic corruption in America's crony capitalism and core economic structures, now we have Wall Street's cash flow flood the Washington trough as they abolish the minimum wage, cut labor protections, and continue to bail out bankers and the wealthiest 0.2%, while cutting normal families' take-home pay.

A universe of naked fanaticism is resolved into an open, power definition of finance and liquidity, reminding me of what was said to She Who Must Not Be Named in Board games of her nightmarish, oppressive nature, by the hero, Billy the Crow, without euphemism. The two-sided Carl's Jr. mask will be artfully raised against the balls of command in continuation to the campaign swirling in and around The Great Recession. Field of Rape and Face Off will continue to surprise through the seasons of bankster fear and denial until the party devolves into a massive landslide amongst their base in 2013. No, something that could not be forgotten how quickly, but just doesn't vanish. It forever fuels corporatism. And corporatism in its final incarnation is ensured with the inadequately scoring A. To end corporate corruption and begin then progress social change, starting with the reality of how corporations abuse others for their own profit of which they have no right, but the profits of which they shame the future-living 108 million.

The real problem of run-of-the-mill ninety-foot television breaks runs something like this: Viewers at home are supposed to imagine it either as a rally or a celebration, so we are led to believe that the world desperately needs a younger Bono. Of course, the excitement of the scene signals that no one in the actual audience is actually dying from AIDS.

Mazda Constellation news updates

Mazda Tuesday set production alert orders Wednesday with plans to make 75 cars a day if the new U.S. federal tax incentives go through next year.


The company halted production amid a worldwide glut of cars on the way to customers, and Mazda is looking at possible layoffs because of the loss of sales volumes.


It is anyway unlikely to see such a significant lowering in standards because Tuesday's production action was only a partial slowdown of Tuesday's 600-baseline-car schedule through the third week of June. The current of production, if all went as planned, would be slightly more than the usual 50,000 a day.


Vehicles are still assembled in the United States and vehicles able to be shipped to the U.S. will reach local consumers by the end of July, according to an industry source.


Leonardo himself instigated the production alerts described last week by one industry official. He has been frequently at the Wall Street Journal headquarters advising on both corporation statements and online publication issues, said Harrison Graymore, executive editor of Automotive News.


The U.S.-based automaker is currently concentrating on people troubles. About 5,000 out of the nation's 47,000 full-time employees are unemployed, and nearly 20,000 walk the picket line, said Mazda spokesman Michael Perry. The number of temporary workers is about the same.


Mazda "is here to stay and will continue to be," said Perry.


Mazda President Muraleedharan said the automaker, the world's third-largest after Japan's automakers, made 1.2 million vehicles in 2015.


Rebalancing


While Ferrari set aside 300 million euros ($325.80 million) specifically for its U.S. development, Mazda is focusing more on revitalizing U.S. operations from its overseas operations.


The company is planning an investment of about 1 billion euros in 2017 to improve operational performance by broadening the footprint of its operations in position to strengthen its footing in an already tough global market for refinement of trim levels of automobiles.


About 100 people worked at the American facilities in 2015, with no plans for staff increases to be announced this year, said the source.


Mazda's decision also was not made easily.


Sometimes manufacturers have to set aside money for employee retraining when costs rise or production schedules are altered in China or other industrial countries. The company is determined to eliminate redundancies and staff further.


Production already was down about 500,000 vehicles per year in North America, according to the source — substantially less than before the global financial crisis, when the European component parts abroad made up just 55 percent of U.S. sales.


In the 18 to 24 month period following global financial crisis, the global component house shipments rose 8 percent to 24.2 million cars, according to the source.


To determine the destination of incoming orders, job expansion needs to take place in order to meet first-quarter production goals for the new model year sedan. The smallest Mazda models aren't before dealerships until this fall, and mazda vehicles clearly are missing from the one-day sales bar at the Detroit auto show.


From Australia to Mexico, slowing demand as the economy chews through the 100-percent local dollar ration has people more interested in used vehicles that aren't full-sized. Mazda makes vehicles in both the United States and China.


Shipments from the U.S. to Hong Kong are down 94 percent from the average sales in 2009, according to the supplier customization manager.


The widely required new fourth-generation vehicle, available in three different trim lines in Europe and more than 10 countries in Asia and 2.8-liter station-wagon will delay baseload delivery until October, according to the Wall Street source. The 2016 body style has longer wheelbase than last year's model.


By the end of the month plans are to move 150,000 units to get on to than full hundreds of thousands of cars in which currency shifts look all uncertain.


Last years four-cylinder IS500 spent some time in Hong Kong and Krome - a supplier of lag fixing parts - as postal service problems in responding to upcoming fall China lunar new year felled offerings before reaching Nazare Mad said analyst Brian Colello of Just Market.


In response to the U.S. and European spot price increase, Nordax said it expects that second pricing of various vehicles to vary by the time they reach dealership sales. Diesel was added as a line of variations in North America back to the 2008 model year.


All are available from dealers through special order. Initially, Chinese buyers will take on the lead from the Germans, who are rafting Valkyrie and Cobalt to such delivery.

Since its 2011 launch, Autoblog has covered the majority of all Autoblog/USA Midwest Youth Outdoors Meet (MYOM) events. Our readers have seen ALL of the events and can often give timely commentary at the request of the organizers. But we've always been informed that there was a large group of older nieghborhood dad scouts, scouts or campers who do not meet mainly because of their profound physical limitations. Senior-age non-campers, people who do not make some of the rosters during camping waters, made up 60% of the safety roster, 60% sport roster, 40% social rotation roster – all to be confirmed at each MYOM – even when asked to stand at a certain table. In short, so many competitions run off a minimum age table that it nearly negated any activity that doesn't have something to do with circulation. Some events include out-of-towners and special guest attractions and this at 16-22% of the overall MYOM seasonal event roster.

But in my experience, the majority of these are men in their 20s or 30s or older, Taco Bell wings ADD, ups and downs, population density issue, desire to skate, which makes yet another bit of dumb, not to say hopeless, planning.

The last byproduct of all this came in the wildest potentiality in my early 1990s around age 20. After seeing a number of events, I embarked on the Land Ho! project, a realistic projection of the number of people missing and either not included in those sports, not wanting to participate or tired of the physical challenges.

In an effort to be a part of my ancestral land, I unleashed the latest high speed replica road in the city of Austin, TX,, which made the "tants" climb that moved at an unbelievable 302 mph at 200 feet on the electric curving talus road. More and more people and families (about 20%) started stopping to listen then participated. During the ride there was only one Texas Ranger present, a breath-of-fresh-air that prevented any altercation.

Recognizing the challenges of my friends and peers, it was critically important to honor this obligation and make it easy at ALL of my regional championships. That is why...

Even though I started with the proposal of doing something inflammatory to release some of this pent up pent up testosterone, I really just wanted to see what it would look like to put together a nice, popular, 2 day competition. Events with locals and others who're from smaller towns as the participants. Steven Anderson and his stuff but led by people who can skate. Equipment. Gear. Not an over used tag for professional studio work but a consistent bar as a show of authenticity, especially for the Youtube viewers and subscribers.

Being a New Yorker, I didn't want to use the program trick race as opposed to any other game in general, like skate scofflaws,Science Fiction promotional thing, Holoplatz. Or anything for that matter. My traveling friends who are involved in turnkey competitions know I've been doing great things with that rather than beating me up for doing my best. They know my mission is a beam B flat type mecca, the catch in frame grinding.

Steven Anderson stuck out as a strong skating talent but a lack of skating experience. So, I, a future greatest living Argentine celebrated by the most. It's my choice and I'm taking it from here.This is my part in the Multi Classic at Manhattan Plaza Motor Lodge and it's going to go great.

This season in the summer, though, Assassin's Creed Fury has ditched the first person perspective for two. You sense a certain pucker of superiority about it all but I digress because going without this first person perspective feels silly, not necessary and a real downgrade for this game.

Trump earlier this week posted two tweets that criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself, calling him "beleaguered" and someone who "will have to recuse himself" from the Russia investigation. On Friday, over the weekend, he angrily tweeted again demanding that Sessions resign.

His account was restored within a couple of minutes on Friday but the Trump administration planned to say this morning that the Senate Intelligence Committee investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election had come across the initial tweet as "inflammatory."

"While the Secret Service does not typically confirm or deny the existence of an active investigation, vulnerabilities to account conclude that the account was compromised as a result of the President's earlier tweet," the agency said in a statement early on Friday.

In a later statement, agency spokeswoman Nicole Mainor said the president's Twitter account and government computers were hacked once before and "in every case, the Secret Service is taking appropriate steps to protect the Secret Service network, computers and data."

The Secret Service took down its own Twitter account after Trump's Twitter messages were disclosed to Congress on Monday.<|endoftext|>An air strike by Saudi jets killed at least 40 demonstrators in the war-ravaged Yemen on Saturday, witnesses said, adding to opposition calls for Venezuela to be one of Middle East's most controversial countries to boycott.

The protest in the northern city of Hajjah spread from Zaidiyeh, also known as Falah, held by Houthi rebels supporters to central Hajjah, where soldiers and alleged Houthi militants clashed.

The protesters were chanting slogans against the Saudi-led war in a turbulent Middle East, the protesters also complaining of being under Saudi siege after the campaign against the Houthis.

This is the first large-scale demonstration since the Saudis started bombing the rebel movement in March, supported by Yemen's President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who has fled the country and headed abroad. There have been other protests in several cities.

U.S.-allied warplanes have also hit Houthi positions.

The Houthis, along with tribal group the Zaidi, denounce the U.S. policy toward Yemen and accuse U.S. President Donald Trump of imperialism. Trump says he will end it when he takes office next month.<|endoftext|>A Nigerian national who allegedly attempted

Hyderabad: The Hyderabad Police on Tuesday raided a drug prevalence detection and Micropeptide testing (PDT) lab allegedly run by a Muslim youth, Ashur Rahman, for illicit activities like moral policing and so-called channels education for video clips. When police raided the lab, it was allegedly found with records that showed he sold 45 pills to students of S.K.V.R Nair Medical College, a government medical hospital in the heart of the city.

When the police went to Ashur's house on Saturday, four students were waiting for him to show them to drug users and peddlers. This led the police to the lab in which the inputs from the student girls first emerged. A bag was found containing 45 pills and 25 packets of CG gels.

Told to find out who ran a lab at a college, the police picked up Ashur, the proprietor of Smugglers' Camp Books. While Ashur said he was the only person running the lab and police had nothing but his words, one of his girls said Ashur had promised to send these drugs all over the country. They arrested Ashur.

This was the first encounter that police had with drug usage in the local area because the college students had told them drug sniffing was rampant according to the students. Following this encounter, police started a drug awareness campaign on school grounds before school shut on Monday. And schools were told to have these procedures.

Thirteen students of the college had written to senior officials of the government medical college and submitted a complaint that drugs were sold there.

Hyderabad Police Commissioner R.M.Laxman told The Hindu that police were closely monitoring the situation. "When we have good legal ground, we will step in. Period". He assured the students that action would be taken against those who sold drugs.<|endoftext|>The World Economic Forum (WEF) announced the June 2015 edition was its 2007 "Leaving Business For Itself Award" winner for the Global Sanctions Infrastructure Project , claiming that efforts to energize grants and prizes, hideous and modest though they may appear, are yielding encouraging results. Indeed, the sponsorship of the yearly body's annual forum for those in business or government exchanges took those six single words for their own sake, and sought to promote the same referential magic via an offshoot platform. Some three hours later and over one hundred thousand words after its explicitly stated purpose, the guidelines for the event gleefully exorcised all that seriousness, as international civic participation doctors manicuring potential sanction model switches. Ignoring the collective threat of the public -- indeed popular far beyond the confines of the event's website -- to take their dissent to the streets, the officials accepted $35.56 million for what, as they wrote, "has the potential to deliver concrete outcomes."


While scratch-fencing lingering partnerships in other forum streets, they vowed to perk up deprived decay spots . States seeking impetus for retained peace were invited to pitch in to assist with the "activation of programs, bodies and structures and grant efforts." Of these grants of almost $11.7 million, nearly $5 million was allocated under their Research Institute-Directed Projects program, each to a team that has a direct (or at least perceived) objective of undermining the increasingly authoritarian stature of their host governments. Given the supposedly underground larp of one researcher, calls to half-page 15 notes that deep-pocket institutional heroes consulted seemed more credible and numerous, suggesting that exaggeration might only account for the annual meeting's comparative yawn of official significance.

A long-standing goal of the Peace Prize for International Cooperation has been to reach a final ranking of nations in terms of human development. Studies on the Early Developing World protection of children and long-term health outcomes derived from international health expert panels have made powerful ethical and pragmatic contributions to this development goal.

Unfortunately, resulting public opinion, and even a few countries, seems to have little regard for these achievements. That suggests that the corporate and government interests from the developed world have subsidized a biased view of healthcare and governance in the rest of the world.

The most recent public opinion survey from the World Health Organization (WHO) Conflict Tactics Conflict Tactics project unequivocally showed that citizens worldwide remain dissatisfied with care for people in the developing world. Also in contrast to the recognition in the 1990s of the highest rates of healthcare complications and poorer adult health outcomes in poorer nationalities, the overall preference for innovations and changes in per capita environment in the developing world seems to have increased since that time.

1) Improved long-term reduction of adult morbidity in the developing world. National surveys show that citizens in almost every country in the developing world want a better life and do not believe that life is getting better.

2) Improved infant mortality in the developing world. According to surveys of adult health providers they feel that quality care and reduced corruption have improved infant mortality.

Though first country negotiators for global trade agreements, the leaders of the Gulf ASEAN and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have also addressed long-standing economic and persuasive issues with regard to human development in general fear that emerging economies will give greater leverage to their more technologically advanced and developed opponents in the world's economic centres.

Another concern of the partners is the ample aid and development funding that the BRICS countries are receiving from these countries. The World Bank and USAID aid totals in 2013 amounted to close to one trillion dollars which makes the disposable income of over 1.5 billion corrupt elites.

For a variety of reasons, the market forces will extinguish the nationalism and religion wars that are engendering vast political and economic challenges in India and Egypt and threaten their access to the dollar. This will free unique ecosystems with strong internal mechanisms of governance and philanthropy.

In the future, select nations can win World Cups and Nobel Prizes, and other nations will acquire neighbors, which built success in terms of healthcare and income between nations selected for top honors.

Can produce very slow tracking frames if the mouse and mouse pad are far away…

When sweeping through a wide array of positions, users need fast action with accurate recoil control. If rotation tracking was accurate enough to support this feature, then it would be as important as turning on a desk lamp after dark. Possibilities for such modes are fairly scarce in any game. Nonetheless, due to the low cost and pleasure of slow motion that fast-moving information can bring, it has become one of the biggest selling points across many genres due to its effect on giving a particular display dynamic highlights.In the popular First Person shooter series Team Fortress 2, there is a unique function called "Coordinate Systems" called the "Grabber" that enables it to be used in a battle. The user activates "nice grips" by holding down one of the thumbsticks, and then unloads an invisible "Tracker" from the central section of the monitor, hanging in mid-air as it coasts towards it's targeted position. The stored state is saved in the console as a 64 bit value called the "OriginPoint," and requires the following commands:(Note that if your monitor is not able to report 48 bits to the console, you may require a speed, find-modual, and repaint to bypass this.)The real beauty of the Grabber is that if you hunch over and press your trigger (the "fruit" adjacent to your nice grips button), the camera will swing 45 degrees in favor of the Grabber, pulling back all of the screens wayward grabber chunks and allowing good trigger response.

Attacking first, then aiming with a scoped rifle is based on rotating a stick in an angle of your choosing. As such, it is easy to select a Stable Animation Selection for your game using setup.exe and an onscreen compass for orientation. Creating arbitrary game script instructions to polygon move the mouse in predetermined ways will be easier to decipher. Also widely required are signedand. For games that support any of the following gamepad options, modifying target tracking is similar; GetMousePositionInFrontOfCursorForWindowedRect will only work with such pad and will call the other ScreenIE or TabletIE methods on MouseMin and MouseMax.

If your graphics card does not support DirectInput, then you can use on_players.MDL and on_players.LBSP files (see below) to control TargetLock or ASmoothMouse then apply standard StateChain and StateMax forms directly to the source model. All multiplayer games will defer controlling mouse velocity to targets' activate translation frames whenever they are ready in order to keep loops simple to read and not overwrite masters' local values.

elite personnel destroy Volkswagen's largest ever dealership in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi on February 6, 2017 (AFP Photo/Mohammed Huwais)

Amman (AFP) - Police on Monday sealed off a former Dubai dealership in the Jordanian capital Amman after a stolen car driven in the country's hot, dry summers, and two suspected accomplices died in the incident.

The two were believed to have stolen the four-wheel-drive Dewa and wrapped it in aluminium sheets.

Police said the vehicle was stolen from a hotel in the city centre by two men suspected of belonging to the Al Dhafra group, linked to attacks in Saudi Arabia that have killed more than 130 people.

The two were killed while the car was still inside, while a vehicle with the stolen registration anda passport of one of the men was also found.

In perhaps the most surprising twist of the case, an officer said the hotel on which the vehicle was stolen -- along with three other found in four days -- had reappeared, the AM reported.

Trading licences from the second vehicle's owner, who is believed to be Syrian, were found in the desert, and police said a passer-by had made the alert when he found a person covered in oil on the doorstep of a hotel and a dead body nearby.

The other two cars were found on Friday night at a petrol station in the Jordanian desert. Among the car was a passport belonging to driving instructor Ismail Luby.

Experts said Luby was suspected by police of leaking other people's taxi drivers' information on drivers through a conference online website, which has become notorious for its legality.

Amman police said 75 investigations were being opened over the suspected involvement of the group linked to the Paris attacks.

The international criminal investigation, known as "Magnitsky case", named Sergei Magnitsky, an auditor from the Russian auditor's office, who was working for US-based investment fund London Capital Group.

Russia subsequently annexed Crimea in 2014 and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe has branded the site's operations illegal.

Forced to close temporarily

Jordan's state Criminal Investigation Department confirmed the case, and said special vehicles and officials were killed when strong winds blew the car off the road.

The police spokeswoman said at least 20 members of the public as well as personnel of Jordan's police chief and army were trapped in the auto garage.

That a stolen vehicle was wrecked by nature's fury on the other side of the world illustrates just how deadly the severe climate is for motorists in simply going for a ride.

"We cannot force these dealerships to remain open, nor do we have the mandate for any kind of enforcement mechanism," the Jordanian Retailers Association said.

Driving licences are already difficult to come by since most people aged over 50 do not have them and it is illegal to sell two expired ones.

Javier Elwes, from the Fair Dealership Coalition, told AFP: "With this incident, people are going to have to think twice before going into auto dealerships."

Defenders of online sales point out that such cars don't pose the additional risk of supporting organised crime.

But the group has pointed out that in December 2015, an hijacked bus full of people bound for central Paris was driven away with its engine running as the assailants demanded the "Auto Sales Law" be implemented for 3 and 4 wheel drives.

"It's a nightmare for all these salesmen," Jordan's conservative King Hussein told reporters in early 2015.

Source of Funds (Campaign Committee), 2009 - 2014

*Includes contributions from other candidate committees.

NOTE: All the numbers on this page are for the 2009 - 2014 election cycle and based on Federal Election Commission data released electronically on 05/18/15 for Fundraising totals, Source of Funds and Total Raised vs Average, and on 08/21/18 for Top Contributors and Industries. ("Help! The numbers don't add up...")

WHY DON'T THE NUMBERS ADD UP? Sometimes it's hard to make apple-to-apple comparisons across some of the pages in a candidate's profile. Here's why: Summary numbers - specifically "Total Raised and Spent" and "PAC/Individual Split" - are based on summary reports filed by the candidates with the Federal Election Commission. All other numbers in these profiles ("Quality of Disclosure," "Geography" and "Special Interests") are derived from detailed FEC reports that itemize all contributions of $200 or more. There is also a time lag in posting the information. While summary numbers are reported almost immediately by the FEC -- and listed quickly on OpenSecrets -- processing and analyzing the detailed records takes much longer. For that reason, summary numbers are usually higher (and more current) than the numbers based on detailed records. HOW CURRENT ARE THESE FIGURES? The figures in these profiles are taken from databases uploaded by the FEC to the internet on the first day of every month. Those databases are only as current as the FEC has been able to compile by that date (see the note above about lag times for data entry). The Center updates figures for "Total Raised and Spent" and for "PAC/Individual Split" a few days after the first of the month. The remaining figures - based on detailed contribution data - is updated by the Center after the 20th of every month. This gives us time to analyze the contributions and categorize them by industry and interest group.

The organizations themselves did not donate, rather the money came from the organizations' PACs, their individual members or employees or owners, and those individuals' immediate families. Organization totals include subsidiaries and affiliates.

Why (and How) We Use Donors' Employer/Occupation Information

The organizations listed as "Top Contributors" reached this list for one of two reasons: either they gave through a political action committee sponsored by the organization, or individuals connected with the organization contributed directly to the candidate. Under federal law, all contributions over $200 must be itemized and the donor's occupation and employer must be requested and disclosed, if provided. The Center uses that employer/occupation information to identify the donor's economic interest. We do this in two ways: First, we apply a code to the contribution, identifying the industry. Totals for industries (and larger economic sectors) can be seen in each candidate and race profile, and in the Industry Profile section of the OpenSecrets website.

Second, we standardize the name

Can our brains be scanned from outside the body and then rewritten over and over to recapture the imprints we left on every part of our brain? Theoretically, definitely. Many scientists are now rummaging through new techniques to do just that.

In 2009, researchers at NASA from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research's Microwave Propulsion Laboratory held a series of contests, including one for "best brain-computer interfaces." In their prize match, teams from around the world competed to develop new brain mapping techniques for ways of collecting data from inside people and rewriting it over and over. One single original BrainBridge video colonized all channels of web-viewing in the world. I've watched many of these videos on YouTube.

On one hand, if you're convinced that the next breakthrough in neuroprosthetics will be profoundly more powerful because better/faster or cooler/more reliable algorithms capture the wiring that connects our neurons, then it makes sense to equip humans with mind-reading implants. But when it comes to real brain-reading devices, there are a slew of caveats, arguments, and threats on the horizon that mean that these technologies cannot take off anytime soon. If you truly think that these technologies will be the basis for a global brain-reading surveillance state, it makes sense to act NOW. Since so much money is on the line (in computers and other components, research funding, patent and trademark rights, marketing, investor interest) making and maintaining a head-mounted-camera program is done with a certain level of speed by enterprises like Google and Facebook.

Certainly, if there's enough money and fair advertising, more companies, like Facebook, would decide the value of adding full-body scanning and rewriting software to augmented reality systems, to let Facebook users over-scan as well as over-write identities to make individual above-ground identities appear visible on the Facebook pages of friends and (currently) strangers. There are also the extreme benefits of getting right down to mind-reading implants, which could be used in its all-female work force, for various purposes, including dreams, talking to your dolls who would also be able to read your thoughts to you, and so forth.

If you thought that the invasive brain-scanning techniques used for the Google Nest team in its backyard was invasive, wait until you see a group of hackers using neuron-monitoring techniques to scan the brains of brains that have been eaten alive and edited–is that not a frightening prospect? Example: in December, 2013, renowned world and science lecturer Conrad Stone unveiled an HTML-5 application that he called the "Geekduino," which developed a touch-screen interface by painstakingly regulating bacterial growth on nerve stumps (absent proper surgical intervention due to the rather discourteous simpletons that take care of such a procedure in many hospitals). The application seems accurate near as humanly possible (through translation) and immune to hacking or malfunction (read: parasitic electronics).

According to Stone, the Geekduino was hacked into free the hacker and grant the creator personality-changing capabilities, for which he sells his own antivirus software. That's really a key point: he is selling his own phony software. But the point is, millions of Internet-connected independent amateur hackers are - and I see no reason to take this past in health with a grain of skepticism. I see no need for them to go to circumvention tools that intelligence agencies-linked organizations fail to stop: build off of research done by actual earth-going scientists because those researchers are employed by the Government, or succumb to the primitive requests not to download the pirated links in the Backup Universe commercially produced NordVPN, because intelligence agencies-linked organizations are working that very hard to stifle what the government is doing.

Just like the point you just read: when it comes to decoupling physiological reactions each of us can display (slightly medicinal without euphoria as well) from larger social/political or technological currents in society, the straightjacket of biggest corporations and organizations will not imprison us.

Since Tesla is focused on developing its autonomous car technology, most of the Silicon Valley government relations machine's work has been focused on packaging that technology in the center console of the Model S and Model X sport utility vehicles.

Musk has not been able to answer directly when Tesla will bring its autopilot software to Model S models.

He has hinted uberpools will be coming next year. But trees and 1,000-lb. weight increases could complicate a decision about having regulators test the program.

That leaves the robots to Buschluss, founded by Scott Sirangelo, founder of video game company Electronic Arts. After attracting tongue-and-cheek investment, the private equity firm has added engineering team and manufactured and sold its first helicopter for special ops training, Reuters reported in December.

Buschluss is pushing 75 live-action demos per week around the United States, but will probably be able to make it happen more often.

"The structure of the venture enables us to get our products fully developed in more than 40 countries before the release of our first generation product, a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle," said Sirangelo, who also joined Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos on Wolfblitzer's debrief.

"Clearly, if we just concentrate on just the U.S. there and really help test the United States and the EU, everyone would be safe. Unless you have a safety requirement that you have to be tested outside of the U.S., it's easy to do technology transfer and help build a helicopter fleet worldwide."

In Germany, a regulation aimed at protecting migratory birds might pressure electric-car companies into building data centers in Germany—something Musk denounced as unnecessary. Sirangelo said the model initially was to bring in small business that would build and maintain facilities.

Even the Chattanooga Times Free Press has said the tech could be taught to self-drive. "Once ushers see how it works, they can begin entrusting it to their sundry valets and cleaning ladies," the telegraphs noted.

But a customer taking delivery of an electric motor would have no time to step out of his car.

Meanwhile, consumers stressed it would be a mistake to make autonomous vehicles more automated than normal.

"I think the safest way is to have a digital person in the vehicle, just as we have caller ID on your phone," at the wheel, said Maddie Jamieson, a Vanderbilt University researcher.<|endoftext|>Show your support for Halifax's best chefs with these affordable and unique Halifax groceries and essential treatments.

The company, which is owned by Take Two Interactive, has said this week that it will be slapping unspecified monetary penalties on consumers who steam the offending installment regardless of whether or not they accept or reject the games' oh-so-hardly-educated relationship fluff in its marketing.

Over the past several months, Business Insider has put together a list of the top 10 cities for business ownership.

While each city is unique — Beijing got the nod, partially because most of Britain's multi-billion dollar business groups set base there — there are a few things you can learn from the advice.

What make a city great for business?

Insiders predict that almost every city has its juice right now. But more important is how successful are the businesses that make it.

Slow growth, weakened consumer spending, often an unsustainable "hockey stick" shape. It's not all bad news, with impressive indicators throughout Western Europe including record revenues, Greece lagging and Munich and London recording small dollar-ish growth. But, as with any market, experienced companies will adapt.

So learning not to copy cultures from other cities doesn't mean treating your Bavarian Schloss the same as your Portland Jony Ive $5 Cafe.

So, in this insightful piece, we all thought it would be a backhanded compliment to showcase our fair city's best and brightest business owners. So who's the top ten in the business world?

Throwing C++ Parties

Perhaps best-known in Chicago, atn is a Cambridge/Boston based software engineering company with a $30 billion valuation and high-flying technology, focusing on enterprise cloud services.

"anything exciting, technological, large out of the ordinary will fly be in the top 10 list of interesting companies to work for" Rolf Turski #Chicago pic.twitter.com/0v9fxuKZ6D — Capital Group Media! (@1company) November 28, 2014

Or, as CEO Eyal Tzur writes on his blog "it's an easier place to rise than in the North," where small businesses often fade. Given the undisputed standing of atn, it comes as no surprise the company ranks near the top of the list of the top 100 cultures.

Twice-Day Medication (not funny!)

Even outside the entrepreneurial Chicago ecosystem, but also packed into neighborhoods and home to major giants like Archie McPhee, Bantelove, Mr. Martini and Minibar, there's no shortage of options.

Two women decided to change that.

Twice-Day Medication created the most innovative approach for last-minute NHS medication. They used social media and word-of-mouth marketing to burst on to a global stage where a multibillion dollar industry needed new priorities and features.

The success stories emanate from the startup incubator GMapeng Chicago, and from the flavor store noted for their exotic fruit items and circular ads that sport the slogan

"Independent Piece of Art."

For the ones that make it, you'll want to keep a Movoto-esque list emailed to you -- give books by Birgitta Hekla and Laura Caplin useful advice on your office.

Cloning Toys = Revenue

Engaging in cute branding experiments with companies is a business strategy for stuffed animals, inflatable slides and string-pulling cello-strummers. But, perhaps out of necessity, consider throwing alcohol: the world's top alcohol beverage cloneer is Cofely, based out of London.

David Lineker and James Mathering will founder several new brands for Lineker's new drink firm following his exit from management.

Here's the thesis, as inventor Shashank Deshmukh explained: their premium vodka becomes vodka when purified of ethyl alcohol and other chemicals. "Vodka is still made from a bunch of apple skins and something, but it's evolved and duplicated for us like appleseeds in our garden."

With 2016 wrapping up, and as the playoffs roll-up, baseball conversation cycles. It's time to look back at October's most striking performances, the hot seasonal names and the big movers. Let's start to tackle the topic of prime-time plays, starting with the game's highlight reel. Oh, and our first standout game of the season is Oct. 25 ...

Top Plays

SHW.Tech.A's Yeferson Martinez hits a three-run home run in Cougs' win 5 and grows a big beard.

CLE.Penn.Eduardo Rodriguez hits a seven-run homer en route to Cougars' come-from-behind win.

Syracuse.Nomar Mazama hits a walkoff homer vs. hosts St. Joe's.

Yale.Josh Helm hits four doubles, including this grand slam.

Idaho.Nicholas Biddle ... oh, are you listening? In a three-run game in Game 1 against Cal State Fullerton, he clocks five hits, including this home run to give his team the lead at 16-all.

A Torch Award winner.

Syracuse vs. Yale: W Saquin Wilson

The story is a little more subtle, but as cheerful as the moment is, Yuki Autio delivered another Humble Brick to highlight his career-year for the Orange. Two reasons to watch down the road ...

French supporters are emerging in Major League Baseball as a British example of the "franchise" model.

1939 AL's were placed on literally every side of the diamond and the top Cleveland player is named just the 12th greatest player of all time.

YP. Fiorasive Seventh Rally Life Andrew Pettitte heavily abuses the right side of his mound ... then he pitches a complete game shutout in a 6'' nail-biter in Montreal's second comeback win on the Wally Mantle about-face.

KD. As of today's Jan. 2, all Yankee's w/ 45 or more DL stints are eligible for reclamation projects.

VP. Hart donations from your favorite vendors to hurricanes affected by Peter Horace Greeley (right) evoke him perhaps more than Ralph Kiner

Mets 4, Padres 1: Maintaining mid-spend Pythagorean RPI at 92 ... with the Mets in solitary possession at 99 on the leaderboard, on eve of a key game of their division series at Petco, the first five figures of that spread-your-fingers-mouth thing shining on steep W's collected a functioning rook-call for the night.

Claim: .... they have no pulse. Despite an average rotation and ace Zack Wheeler in excellent shape, one has to wonder how long the Isotopes can sustain their old level of offensive for three straight weeks without an effect on their belabored Triple-A shift. It certainly gets the wheels back in motion in March.

Civilian coaches merely feel out one fully half of their squad. The good that can come from a year's experience in the promotion process can both hugely challenge an inexperienced DC's strength and foreshadow sharp instructional tweaks in subsequent spring metamorphoses. In the couple-month-plus gap since his demotion via veto from the Mark Grudzielanek epically understandable frontal firing/resigning, B.J. Upton's personal divide may be helping inform new media sales, as have his or his off-field rehab outings, and - eek out better-reasoned choices here. We gotta wait til next fall.

Dubbed "People's Pot", Hongkong was the only region where the election had uncorked all the opportunities of Hongkongers' leading indulgence.

I have been to New Zealand almost as many times as I have been to Hong Kong, and I've approached similar questions a little differently. I started with mystery. There is a small selection of western criticisms about Hong Kong's political behaviour and democracy – hegemonism, a legacy of colonialism, cloning of local Western free-market socialism by Dutch you-know-who, political disconnection, and finally, excessive centrality. A commitment to each of these makes me suspicious. I wanted a not-too-clean-sweep. If such points really exist, why wouldn't they have justified the motion of the People's Party to forge an unbroken line of evolution and self-evidence through puerile, terrifying cannon-fodder? I sought a new weapon to tackle Hong Kong's defenses.

Generations of US policymakers saw not only power but a certain way of acting in foreign affairs flourish without strong boundaries from the US side of the Atlantic. During World War II, US officers would sit out a majority of speeches, but in peacetime, using the Korean War as an example, many US bureaucrats would lecture Chinese leaders on their human rights practices – subject to no limit in the democratic countries. In China, they would have to grapple with a growing number of Chinese intellectuals who would refer to privilege and hegemony as the fundamental problem to be solved. In 1977, I returned from travelling the country during the Mao Era and found that everyone's generation could sense how Mao was undermining staying power as the hegemonic power[1]. Once Mao had spent three days openly insulting Deng Xiaoping, there was little hope in Beijing that the Great Helmsman would staunchly insist on loyalty to Chang Kai Shek who chose to retreat from Yan'an, for fear of a Mao-Tao Rebellion in his rear guard during the Korean War. Which forces could speak to and establish relationships with with, but would never translate into power.

There is a long list of "foreign power" Veni, vidi, vici, in combating "produced" stagnation starring "special". But all changemakers for serious change need to be chosen by citizens, motivated by continuing loyalty to agenda in jiexi and mainstream. If the conservative influence in Hong Kong is in part self-projected by a Veni Veni powerful enough to spin easily performance of democratic electoral power, Tea Party parties obvious proof of civic devotion and mutually successful strategos would prove success and compatibility

The fact that I was speaking of veni vidi left me with a ceaseless sense of movement, an absolute feeling of resonance in watching people that humanity had overwhelmingly influenced, mostly indirectly in effective political realism, from 9 Plants residing in Transform Gang Valley alternatives tillstood themselves a political labor bettered public confidence to speak and listen to Hongkongers pampering themselves with singular exploration of the truth, heritage, power and integrity of powerful potent dark forces in as growing a trust in the future awareness. The overwhelming majority of Hongkongers had been exposed to similar insights in primary education and consequently by its extreme standard a landscape. Visibility of dominations over any and all explicit actors gave power projection an auxiliary character.

Jayasuriya's Qijie (tuning of autism) addresses student identity in post-colonial prsexuality of suitability

"extraverted segments of the 1 million Hong Kong people, possessed with vivid imaginations, or rather with complex visual neurotic ups and downs in autism include a student population who naturally understands plays of words and situations better than questioning analyses. The quest of these many students for knowledge had been for many decades for access to power's outsider-oriented carnival; fixed employable and disposable become discrete animating ideas ("play of words" as outlook for conservative era) limited objects/objects and unilateral multipliers of needless import"

Political movements reveal lies, small and large. Demagogues have gone wild in the pitch heard above pandering to uninformed or ideologues, doing their darnedest to obscure the underlying tricky truth and in diffused meanings, no matter how marked. Therefore, this experience looks both bleak and hopeful, and rather doesn't offer any framework to discriminate the margins. Definitely engaged with jazz musicians, Hongkongers often drift anarchyere natere, dandy duplicant but sometimes creative powerhouse. Although play of words can be wordless, struggling to search for a logic to process their sincerity has been a major challenge. This is especially apparent among deal breakers, for instance in gathering and capturing tape while underground cell structure – like Sun Yat-sen's "Guerrilla Printing" and a win for free initiatives by the cops. Park Chung Hee, the "State Security organism's idea" of Chief Executive designed to unite those he resonated links together his conservative predecessor, "Pinochet",

Galactic clusters of stars form naturally within the Milky Way galaxy, and the tight grouping can now be captured through a NASA spacecraft JWST that is set to be launched in 2019.

Erick Clearwater, a graduate student of the University of Maryland, explains,

"NASA's new Hubble Space Telescope promises to reveal even larger clusters in the very distant past than previously thought possible. By understanding how those massive clusters initially formed, astronomers can then understand how these distinct formations—known as "zombie galaxies"—have given rise to massive stars with their equally distinctive morphology and colors. Hubble will also help us understand the extinction events, violent collisions, that scar and splinter the cosmos, helping us understand the complicated behind-the-scenes process that produces life."

The results are in

Unity Dev Kitchen features a bunch of games built for Unity that take the "love-it-or-hate-it" approach. In this post, I wanted to give you an explanation of how the learning results from the website that I've been watching for a while.

Here are the numbers for Unity Dev Kitchen. These numbers are from the xtent: 150 posts with 25K builds. The big picture idea here is that the "games that work in one day" result has been skewed a bit by the big spike after Unity 5 when all the low-income devs were rushing to get back in the game.

During this week, Unity 5 delivered 11.3M downloads all up. For those 622M monthly visitors, Unity 5 accounted for 0.0039% of monthly traffic. That's a lot smaller than the 0.0048% in June 2013, and a lot smaller than the 0.01% last month.

Then there's the "games that works in one month" results. Again, I'll wait for them to post the results for August (the upcoming release month).

February was November for the full month. October of last year was April.

Time to take a download

Everybody walks around with their little sand-sanboxing tool that splits your speck of an scene into chrome and other windows – Things like that. Or their CAD machine that creates a 51/49 color separation in 2 axes with some coffee can and Dymo mesh, etc..

Then, you make a call to get a ghost model, lots of resources, etc. etc.

Master Ninja – Jonny Scharf

Unity's Unity Master Ninja, Jonny, is teaching people how to demonstrate some very complex scenes in Unity. He does a good job of explaining things like using 1 VP in your scene or 2 of each object for camera perspective and how to work correctly with blur/bloom (great tip).

To take part in this one-day workshop, you'll need a Unity Runtastic account. I'd recommend this one given the sharing link above. You learn a lot and it'll be my challenge to run the 8-hour immersive workshop for real this very summer. In the end, that's what really matters at Unity – being able to do amazing things on a daily basis. The community really thrives on you succeeding in this way. So, let's sign up!

A quick catch with Unity's CEO Dave Betz: he frequently makes videos on the Unity Connect channel about the Unity Coaching program through the Community forum. Here's some of the wisdom he shared with them:

Use a stage light instead of a gizmo and spatial placement of props

Show and don't tell. Assume your audience knows very little about your scene.

Good descriptions work better a hundred times over than long stories. Make people understand your scene with movies and pictures and not in words.

Learn from the next person who is building a complicated scene

Story development is almost always a mature skill if anyone is serious about it

A four-year-old Sikh boy, who was sworn in to the UK's Royal Sikh Regiment (RSR) last week, was forced to apologise to his American-born school friend for inadvertently comparing him to a dog on Facebook.

Members of the Division 1 Sikh Regiment (DSS) will be less than impressed when the three-year-old reveals what he meant, given his experience of both the US and US pluralities.

According to the Regiment's website, "two or more Sikhs Serving under the same flag is an honour of a totally private nature. It belongs only to them". Its member oath, also written in Nepali, says: "It is my duty, complete and wholly, to honour and obey my sergeant. And I take all simple commands courteously, even those which upset junior sergeants because I am the first to take an oath and to follow my order without straining the arm or stirring up dissension in unit, and directed only by the Sergeant or his assistants, commanders or major group leaders."

The RSR website states that no religious or political limitations apply to its members.

When 21-year-old Andrew Dalroy, a Colorado-born Sikh American living in London, first met the Sieh Wallinder at school, he noted about the fourth-grader that he was "usually very quiet and rarely spoke as a normal adult would". That changed when the boy loaned him his book, about dragons, and asked about one: "Sikhs are a dragon kind of people?" And we really are. I used to be Gshalens, but i changed my name]. Kids in the US tend to give names to other kids [in real life]. Anyone can call anyone else by the name in the US, but in real life it's very unclear," Dalroy said.

Indeed, Sikhism got an up and down start in the US but modernised in the mid-20th century. Today, 29 million Sikhs live in India, Mauritius and Nepal and a total of 535,000 reside in the United States.


Surely, 'dragon people' ("Gshi) are not allowed to be called by any name but the one they were given? And Andrew wrote a letter to tell the school that without correcting the harm caused, he already considered Wallister a rapist. Ha! I wonder if this will have any effect at all — 'thank you' to the school for covering up the problem?

Lipstick on a pig? (always a sign)

But did the boy mean to put Wallister's sex into a positive light? A little screen cap on the District school website showed Karen Wallinder wearing nothing but luscious lips and hair as she held out her best 'wife' smile. Hell, even he could recognise that.

Whether the decision to let Andrew feign English and swear at the Parsi soldier archetype of Wallister (He was appointed identifiedattva Parikh by his chosen Guru) went through the school's heads or not, Dalroy pointed out that its 'Special Occasion' event didn't include any New Age interests. Would he want to go to the school on patrol tomorrow, after its diversity education programme ended, knowing that Schoolmaster Sir, it's not permissible to insult humans whom you are supposed to protect? And 12 years old is a little far for his young hearing. What about the Internet?

Will a month long holiday help Wallister disenchant the American's enthusiasm for women in uniforms?

But we can't forget about the third-level teacher who told Dalroy- Wallister and Andrew did not divide right, without mentioning the army test. Is Jasmine Gupta, who has taught Hindi at sixth grade, parents, and homeschooled boys, likely to be asked to have English lessons with these children after June, after she signed off on Mr Dalroy's letter to the school?

So once again, Wallister Wallister needs to be investigated by the brass. Even for Sikh youngsters, it's never a good idea to make a seven-year-old boy admit that he is creating a new identity without really focusing on "humanising" the child and getting him comfortable with his own skin colour. And as for Andrew Dalroy, he has said that as a IHRA beginner he must be totally open in answering every question children ask without hiding his feelings.

Parenting is all about adapting the upbringing prerequisites with the child's growth stage and needs. And in this case, Dalroy had a learning curve ahead of him, and a smart teacher.

What is the most special about this case, apart from the deep sense of injustice and outrage at the atrocities committed by Muslim murderers against the Sikhs in the 1990s?

The answer is of course compassion.<|endoftext|>We first set to work in the north of Spain in 1802 and, in combination with the psychologists of recognizing and ethics, we

A Wanted sign points to mug shot of murdered Pennsylvania man Jerome Eve.

Discussions concerning parts of Jesse Feliss eight-page suicide note have been ongoing for several months among the Insane Clown Posse faithful.

A lot of the conjecture concerning the note was shaped by the fact that Feliss had written that he did not want to be a part of the group anymore. The Clown Posse has much more of a personality of its own than Feliss did. Some of the questions and some of the theories that have been published are baffling.

One of the most frequently cited theories is that Feliss was stabbed numerous times. No Auto-Crossing records have been found to corroborate this theory, however.

According to the FBI, Jerome Eve was murdered on November 3rd, a Saturday. Eve and a friend had returned to their home in Fishers, Pennsylvania after forming a New Emporium in New Jersey. While Eve's friend was waiting for them to arrive, he was grabbed by two masked figures and placed inside a car. The masked men then used a vehicle to plow into Eve's friend.

From there, the two masked figures jumped in another car and fled. No witnesses saw them take off, but a band of twelve neighbors all went to the house in the dead of night in an effort to find the lunatics and get home together. They eventually found their friend outside on a dock. They then held Garden Whitners accountable for their death. The two masked men were of course never traced, so this theory is very popular with cartoon fans and the ability of a Chicago cop to be paired with an infamous band is quite a cult hero.

The insgar goo comedy band continues to serve Chris Butler and his merry band of wrestlers in illfate acts.

On Twitter, @Joeuirilana tweeted about this theory and someone responded saying "Booty in the mirror and let out a sigh~" When other people claimed that Feliss was looking for an apology from the insgar band, this commenter said, "That doesn't work too well with a chassis."

Did Fel, aka Jose "Janey" Perry, A.K.A. Mob Wipeout and the technical wizard Christopher Bibbs, A.K.A. Equalizer, Vietnam 52 ... or, was he murdered by people he thought were his closest friends, legends from Western Pennsylvania who divided right up the middle because of music and fan interest?

Feliss did remember loads of periods in his life so it would be hard for a report to say that he committed suicide by anyone but suicide.

We have contacted Chris Bibbs (President/Poet/Model/Walk-On for the Insurgents), Justin Vitter (aka Ketch Boop) (Wraps/Along with Doder), whom many fans of the Insane Clown Posse have figured out to be Joey Deeez --A.K.A.

Elijah Cummings (D., Md.) told Yahoo News he will be leading the investigation into a White House data operation that might have solicited leaks on social media, or been impacted by foreign hackers.

The Democratic congressman told Yahoo News, in the wake of The New York Times' report this weekend that President Trump asked FBI Director James Comey to let go of the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, that he would lead an independent inquiry.

Cummings, who assumed his post in 2011, sponsored and lost a bid for re-election by a special election last fall, withdrew from House Democrats' consideration to run for Senate majority leader on Friday.

In a brief interview from his Capitol Hill office, Cummings said that while he no longer will run for re-election, those motivated to take him on will face stiff opposition from fellow Democrats. On Tuesday, another prominent Democrat, state Sen. James Brochin, indicated he, too, had no plans to run for leadership as a specious and unqualified attempt to "rewrite history."

That means the U.S. economy is now the most uncompetitive in the developed world and it is about to stay that way for at least the next few years with the latest projections showing Japan's economy, now the third largest, will overtake the U.S. in share in 2013.

The International Monetary Fund released its latest Global Outlook on Wednesday and painted a picture in which an unprecedented global attack on labor on wages was beginning to take its toll.

Released just as Labor Day seems to be here, the IMF urged an instantaneous push across contentious grips to reach the Columbus Day deadline just 15 months away.

According to Reuters, the IMF said most countries "had effectively entered into a 'two-speed' economy—a small number of large expectations presence way above average productivity and wage growth, and a much larger group (around 1.5 billion) with diminished or still low expectations."

For instance, it said about 40 percent of the world's consumption will come from prosperity on the backs of the poor over the next decade. But families will have to spend 21 percent of their income in the U.S. on things like health care, education or housing and on a host of other social costs that are rapidly depositing absolute economic strain, like transportation.

An item included in the IMF Report is central banking:

According to the Bank for International Settlements, central banks are a sector with 25 percent of total employment and earn 30 percent of total income in the global economy, often with much more severe effects on growth and tariff adjustment. It should be no surprise then that central banks have been in retreat in the U.S. and other major economies, and are closing the door on the consolidation of risk banks. We expect all four major Federal Reserve System banks to shrink dollar policy would undermine growth in the years ahead without drastic TINA effects such a porting of reserves from Europe and Japan to the U.S., where they should grow. InEurope, Miller notes that many economists believe that the new decline of currency exchange rate liberalization means that advanced economies are gradually moving toward more competitive exchange rates… That is, potential growth in China is clearly underserved by its way of setting the Chinese currency upwards to a level at which it turns down the competitive power of currencies like the euro for exports. That is going to mean goes to mean that China is going to see additional moves toward moving into the competitive position of other key export countries, such as India and early next decade potentially other developing economies.

According to the IMF, the U.S. was not the only paid off nation in Europe on Wednesday.

Europe is to experience a gross decline in central banks nominal interest income of 13.6 percent from a year ago, while China actually expected to see this rise to 18.2 percent.

Not only that, but Italy and Spain both said the UK would dampen its economic comeback.

And just like the New York Fed, the IMF that anticipates the crisis is in a room full of risks, most significantly of a run on Greece and other countries, and those countries becoming forced out of the Euro:

This in turn could trigger a significant retaliation at sub-euro zone countries with large banks that could lead to a reinforcement of bets against embarking on further reduce had central banks decreased interest rates further down the road. This would prompt a further reversal among other central banks on the ECB's bond purchase program, and this leads to considerable adverse effects on the realization even if policies could find some way to complement the naturally distributed costs of credit creation or the desires of depressed consumer markets in typical developed economies of reporting National of Debt-free issuance.

Although those Will be as early as November of this year, this dire forecast will be as true in the U.S. as it is in Europe.<|endoftext|>A Democratic congresswoman surprised supporters Tuesday as she called for "real leaders" to address the crisis in Venezuela.

======================================== SAMPLE 116 ========================================
Tutelo Island (カツライイア, Kutaraia?), the "Utah Emblem," is a Korean sand arts city where famous body art and erotic art are sold. It has been described as "Korea's New York" or "Art Deco." There are many islets in which one can find realistic beach designs with evening or nighttime scenes. Women's bodies and men's hands are completely painted black or white. Some of the islets are dotted with models themselves and others are populated with family members. The erotic tents sit along the seawall corner with men and women putting on games and enjoying themselves. It is not a safe area so much as an exciting playground.

Windows

All the windows of the buildings are swimming pool windows with a shade and the people can hold towels while working. The low-rick pop near the window are doing annoying directions for tourists.

Location

Tutelo Island is located in the middle of Korea by the Han River. The distance from Seoul to Tutelo Island is about 137 kilometres or 89 miles. Many tourists come to this island in search of familiar local cuisine and evade the tourist wave because of bad weather or shortages of bases where you can rest and take pictures for yourself. Get maps from hotel restaurants or KTV shops. The ferry can be linked from Han River to Marina Lake.

Houses

Visitors can find typical houses on the island, but one can only call this island by the name of the city they plan to visit. Architecture and street design are based on the culture of Venice. As a consequence, visitors who plan to stay in the area must enjoy the beach-front environment. Hogweed flowers hang onto eroding sidewalks, little postcards are covered with fuzzy paint and the streets are wide despite no yard. It is the most segregated cultural city after Seoktan which has thieves and trouble-makers. The only things you look for are a 10 kroner parking card and an empty boat ticket into Mukdong River.

Q&A

I came here for diving but I couldn't find any. How could that be? (August 2, 2018)

We spent roughly three hours in clear water under the white coral. You can dive well at that depth, however much rum you drink, there is zollution! Look for the sensational cod, grouper and red broadfish. The fish lunch you can decorate with salted fish, not the crab sauce.

What is the best way to see the pigs in the city? (March 30, 2017)

Of all Pyongyang's pocket pigs, the largest are little black and white ones. The freshest poodles are very old (ex. 80 years) and are dumped here with the pigs and lays eggs in the back half of the tunnels. At YIl, the rooftop of the hotel, they are inside the buildings and is an Abekun Pork Roja and they really eat everywhere.

Where is the beach a 100 kroner size #cutemangoes? #nyemongoes (May 16, 2016)

The one on the left you get one lots of plastic knitvnhpees and try to pinch all the pretty eyewear. It's 1-2 days on the sandy beaches. White clouds in the morning, misty over the whole day, full hairs of surf, beautiful colors, it's nearly impossible to swim on the beach caused by giant waves eating the same spots as Sunjung.

Vending

On your right side in the big screen TV there are little inky looking bottles to place souvenir of your visit here!

Diving

On the lake of Tutelo Island there is no water right now. However, you can go to Noum Island across the Han River, where the water is exactly the same as on Tutelo.

Age

If you said top, you are right! We thought it was an adult bar/cafe but it wasn't. They were interested in two kids who were 10 and 12. Even though the tables were locked on the 10th floor after dark, they were only really interested in keeping an eye on the kids, especially the younger ones. It was so strange that they even met with the owner of Skyking.

Local guides need to maintain public safety and security rules and offenses more carefully. This means not just keeping the sea walls clean, but keeping them close to the window and not allowing the naked people on the water. But there are also some nocturnal affairs (found hundreds of times a year) that cause controversy and creepy abandoned rooms are scattered around the island.

To get to the beach, you cross the main street near solarium. On the left they have a bathroom, bathroom. On the right there is a building, but with the front of the hotel completely removed. At night, they try to prevent the same thing from happening.

Kinky Shag Walks has gone viral, and with good reason! Since its launch a couple of years back, we've seen plenty of people who've gotten off on the idea of locking up cunnilingus toy again and again and going kinky, as shown by our Kinky Shag Walks short film.

Life, however, is full of adjustments, and not all of them are good ones. This uncomfortable demotion of the Kinky Shag Walk from a daily workout partner to merely a "go-to" idea is one such adjustment. Up to this point, practicing kinky turns down in the lapband was entirely safe. But in the case of the Alex Touch, the crotch is anything but a smooth slide, which is that nasty insecurity of use which can lead to something from putting up with harsh notches to sensitivity when the toy isn't calibrated or set up perfectly properly, and possibly an with loss of your hands.

Okay folks, story time. Mark and I have now been using this toy more than a half-dozen times, more than I'd like, but we're keeping it going after reading the manufacturer's literature. Everyone says the Alex Touch is actually amazing. I'm going to highlight one of the pros and a couple of the cons of using it and what I continue to do with it. I do not recommend purchasing this until you have been properly trained with it. Your instructor should have as much practice with it as you have. If you can't even get the Alex Touch to roll around in your lap without being careless, then a leather harness might be for you.

In December of 2009, Executive Functional Wonderful James Deen was attacked online by literally dozens of disgusting hate-filled, very very serious trolls who made many of his personal and private adventures public and managed to have a massive impact on his life. We know all about this story because Deen had extraordinarily harsh words for these haters in his interview with Sock Doc Book to promote this book. These trolls were circulating Deen's names, addresses and other personal information in an attempt to harass him and discredit him. Luckily for Deen, the bullies failed and he had a very worried Facebook and email list of 161 friends from all over the world that rallied around him for protection and safety. Here is what he said in an interview with Sock Doc Book: "I was pretty good at sitting down and putting hot sauce in my pockets to pretend it was weapon even though in reality none of that stuff can hurt people but sometimes you have to move, you have to defend yourself, and it's better to punch someone in the face than it is to bury them alive." He was on the battle front and dire circumstances knowing he could prove the haters wrong. He fought back with vitriolic. merciless, angry content that stayed with his fans until the end of his life and fans in this new book.

Mr. Obama's new homeland-security budget is expected to include $600 million to produce and distribute a high-definition version of a government video "to warn folks about the dangers" of surfing the Web through public Wi-Fi, the administration said in an email to Representative Dan Lungren (D-Calif.).

The budget would also provide $97 million for 25 new employees who will monitor the nation's public web-camera networks as part of a project to systematically search the billions of images harvested by them. This counters a pending bill in our Congress, H.R. 5415, that might improve the hiring and training of these camera technicians already operating in public locations and waste an estimated $2 billion per year "flying unqualified, ineptly trained employees to locations around the country," the White House claim said.

"Evolving hardware, declining budgets for surveillance technology, our continued online presence and the ability to gather and analyze more information are using bad guys' digital strategy," White House spokesman Tommy Vietor told me. Homeland security spending was already planned to shrink, as I reported in February, for 2012 compared with 2008, by a third, or $28 billion.

The Obama administration might argue, as some Senate conservatives are, that man-in-the-middle attack is in the eye of the beholder. If I got an iPhone code-named "Sarcasta" with a microprocessor based on the ARM architecture, that would be bad, but if such a device were powerful enough that it could eavesdrop on my communications and meddle with my location, believe me, I'd be interested in finding out just how good the attack strategy was.

But it seemed almost impossible until last week, when A.P.S., which Mr. Obama will effectively control, released its new system, or "roadmap," to support "world-class Internet security," which potentially means much better. When it comes to search, the algorithm is incomprehensible, and it doesn't seem to help with pinging a known location — but for e-mail, the H.264 compression standard does.

"I don't understand it," I told it, knowing full well that I was lying. A.P.S. regards the internet as a public utility that is not theirs to replace.

Lake Oroville – The people of southern California had a heartwarming surprise in store on Wednesday — as the region's water reservoir grinded down to its lowest level in 87 years.

Lake Oroville — which lies behind the cities of Oroville in Yuba County and Folsom in Sutter County — reached 463 feet, more than 10 feet below the water level that had been predicted before the January storms that ultimately dumped 613 million gallons of rain on Southern California.

A satellite image of the water level at Lake Oroville. Some experts use an added weight amount in their calculations that hovers between 33 and 34 feet below the water level.

The stock was down $33.78 due to the tapering off of rain here in the San Joaquin Valley.

The lower water level at Lake Oroville is a health hazard for residents who flood much of the valley. The lake water doesn't get transferred to the San Joaquin River because it has to stay under 1,000 feet, and that largely prevent the water from getting to the delta.

After the storms, it didn't seem likely of less rain would come for a few more weeks, as a strong cold front was on its way.

As compared to the flooding that happened in 1780 was the amount of rain unprecedented in the San Joaquin Valley.

Then, during winter of 2012, a flash flood destroyed part of the Spanish mission and killed horses and cows because no one had any alternatives turned off toilets.

Are climate change/global warming impacts going to be what causes the water to come down so fast?

Scientists have discovered that older mothers who take drugs to prevent being pregnant may have a higher risk of neurologic disease improving the life of their offspring.

Published in Nature Communications, the study took 13 countries including eight European countries, Lutheran countries, Germany, Portugal and the USA, and calculated the contribution of environmental and nutritional factors to the risk of Alzheimer's disease developing in an individual's late twenties/early thirties.

Because women are often exposed to multiple environmental risk factors early in their reproductive years, the study prompted experts to question whether it is wiser to counsel mothers-to-be against using drugs to prevent pregnancy such as Depo Provera.

The increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease

The research team was astonished to find that women who suffered early miscarriages-an indication that they are in the irreversible second stage of pregnancy-had more children born to an Alzheimer's creator averading such illness than those without a history of intrauterine dysfunction. Furthermore, pregnancies occurring at 10 to 18 weeks' gestation had a three times greater incidence of Alzheimer's than those within the first trimester.

The team found that average pre-pregnancy BNP concentration was 270 nM in women using chloroquine prior to pregnancy in Brazil, Latvia, Luxembourg, France and the USA, while that guess had risen to almost 975 nM by weaning of the foetus prior to ovulation.

Further, there was a lower than expected prevalence of NPD-associated polymorphisms-in the fast delocalized amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 2/docosahexaenoic acid signaling axis region involving Prader-Willi- duplicated genes that are known to be associated with neuronal health.

Breathe in my perfume. I am here."

Anyone who has spent time "hidden" under car seats, or was blocked by an open door while walking home from a night out, can relate to the driving-avoidant nature of spoiled toddlers. School shooting nits and smelly friends haven't done much to soothe this grumpy baby well-nurtured to a frustrating end. We're driving home from our local campground, smelling the sun-warmed Appalachians and those maddening dogs and whining hares. Fortunately, we began smelling each other just before the unhinged child charges up that winding mountain road or veers into our neighbor's car. But whatever twinges of drill sergeant stone-throwing make us run like hell are all so we don't have to inhale Happy Jack or a bunch of bodily odor.

Unfortunately, no calming, mending fluid is available for him with no choice we have but to "feel" like the worst mothers who ever lived. The only option for our insecure toddler is to hop onto their guy loud car seat at the side of the road. Luckily, the seat is very high up, so the nausea from anxiety and his bloated bladder tires him slower than new moms getting in car seats for first-time dads. Hopefully, running for the nearest car wash helps offset his embarrassment in a quiet area. Another writer charged that it's all an excuse for him to *smell your* car. This stinks, dude. If you smell my car, I'll vomit. Even without a need for a tow truck, it just proves you're in the wrong place at the wrong time.

When you break free from your traumatic life without just one child crying inside your miserable house, it's always a double privilege to use those vacuum techniques to keep up with poop-digging attention seekers. Eventually, most of them stare you down and ask what you're doing. You say, "I'm cleaning dogs paws." Smell around them, admire their dirty clammy skin and spreading and burrowing and dry fully jiggling cheeks, and say, "Hits it. Passing grade."

4 Teenage Smells

This tool gets its plasticky, tinny flavor from ammonia. It rules the pediatric elimination table with regard to itself. Nasty, yes, but the preferred scent for sneaky tweens is formula, their PB&J lunch. That's PEEK, just as adults say, as well as powder. Stick your head beneath the canopy of a car seat long enough for your teen to grow bored with the sleep surface frame and torrential moisture drone and decide to gorge herself on the product of her upbringing. Were he legit member of the LGBTQ community, that's when smelly items might touch his skin. It's probably not good for his birthing habits.

5 Little Patty

Remember Jones the talkative boy? The one with a spelling and grammar brain defect? Sometimes, as his demeanor slowly soaked up painful noise followed by medical intervention and then failed children matchmaking, he'd season his literary attentions with fart attempts.

That's the correlating phenomenon Leslie Helse Parker discovered when she interviewed 93 young women aged 14 to 20-years-old for the FX series Satioms. It's a voice that cloaks for girls, and most stigma is attributed to female bro room conversation. Whatever improprieties exist — whispers under the table, totally scaled it out with suitable versions of salad dressings, floor pop — women are whispering because girls are talking.

Pediatricians are seeing increasingly motivated and I'm inclined not to believe a single prurient remark about the self-mutilation. "I hear it all the time from guys, especially late in a first night." Use your trufax to brush up on your linguistic chops. Traffic jam stays at traffic jam. Shallow rectum dealership serves dank vegetation. Farts are Bonhommes Farts papisseries.

2 Smell Boys

Don't get it twisted, indeed. The objects of odor are so singular that any meaning eventually gets relegated to shameful linebacker types. But if. If little boy is fucking using the odor to deal with copious amounts of human faeces on the faucet, fuck him. Otherwise, dump his tray of broccoli, broccoli florets and apparently poop pectin-based broccoli sauce at least every so often.

3 Poo Poo. (Cognitively) Defeated

"If I simply smell him for 10 minutes, does it take him somewhere down a path to puberty?" a professional asked rhetorically over Instagram. Now, this is just the purview of groups like Young World, a child psychiatrist who not only smells humans at three Los Angeles shelters but provides advice to troubled teen BRUT users. But illegal oil in the sink might get you exactly the opposite reaction. "That molester and his 12,000 friends smell like a

Given it's first day of the new year, we here at the Edge have decided to break down all of the fifteen games and free content that have dropped in the past month. This will be a series here on the site with something happening every day leading up to December 31, 2013.

News


Legendary Items – All Hallows Eve and Full Moon cycle players have claimed new ways to advance in multiplayer with two new seasonal Legendary items to add depth to their characters.

Party Mobs – Players can now summon members of their party regardless of their current host using the line "ooc soul once", this combination allows for a host that may not be suitable for solo play. However, they are able to participate in the opposition and at least one box will pickup the player making option.


New Art – These new Legendary canons will change the tone and textures of the game in terms of how players look with the additions of new eye customizations or change as to what their wearing. Some are more dramatic while others are like a generic uniform.

Over-Crafted and 2 Slot Quest Spots – In the returning content of Year 0, the unused GM slot 1 has transformed into a 7 slot vendor. This will replace the old option of Blue from version 1.05, but it's not expected to even go live for beta 3. Players will have a further opportunity to reserve space on the new slot befitting of being serious quest givers with the Legendary

Daily Dungeons – In one of the more eclectic preview talks, C.A.N.T Solutions has been offering their cybertank and unique catching traps in Exchange Town daily dungeons. These are memorable and innovative in everything that they say from their use of players in non-combat divinations which have casted a destructive spell onto Argus. It turns down this summer, Offworlders will be placing a decent save at the FF8cd (Heros' actual DF can claim any spot in the world they wanted to after killing 30 level 20 enemy FFX IVs) which offers brand-new Delve dug into inside of Argos. Inside they discovered the alien hands of Flux, the same race forced in shame of future Final Fantasy X.

New Field Gags – They can be locked up in your town from CBT version. These are a bonus shed of dialog for the first Golden Flare, confirming messages will hire along side this event which run every day 7am-9pm PST.

Bind Skill Guides For Part 2 – From subject matter expert Dylady, a form of Major in this week is to try and teach the battle/job mechanic system of the FF9 Final Fantasy series, the Binding Blade, the process to create your own new skill builds. This must be made use of while the BSB search helps with slotting and material utilization ideas. It also establishes the norm for unlocking the overbooked Lao-Shan part of the growth chart.

Super Capital – In addition to a colossal Sun farm venture that offers purchase of Wheat, Potash and Neuroscience Roxas can negatively clue Garland instances ordered. If the lvl 52 Mythril encounters are being broke.

Periodic Cave – Cross the common river in Luna Caverns and West Falcon for a shrine containing an instant auto drop and let the graveyard gremlin go to work itself. The changes made are at the expense of the GD as it's base is far more open rather than the wind-yard, a massive layout.

Cheat Codes 2.0 – Alphastorm has gone to long to create the community party stash in Alexander Forest this week making it far more collaborative. Chirality has now added gamification to the cheat code collecting stream. With two new objectives you just have to complete and get your equipment from the functions/pages associated to that objective. The 'Absolutely Flare' objective trades oyster keys for Codcoins, Gems and

Medals that can be used on other achievements.

3 New Characters – The devs have today also been unveiled their new. Since up until this week, they still had been under wraps, but they debut late in the IDs 214 classic times loads (probably Airship only), bringing in a variety of new characters from the various video games that are set for Beta 3, Expanded Range of Characters (Excluding The originals), and quite possibly Missing Chocolates' forthcoming mystery character. Below is a idea of fun things they may and may not teach,

Other Announcements/Actuals Twitch streams will be interesting, and we'll be sure to bring you more as they are available.

George spins magnesium using a Unicram pricing 101 model again ;-) .

So far as I understand the marketing material, the Giga produces 35 W and weighs about 0.5 kg.

"And the Unicram pricing 101 model again! My guess is that the Giga' would cost about the 99.9 USD / GBP / euro price in £/JPY/ $, but way less than in USD / GBP / euro."

(no/yes definitions for sizes required) And that's EU based thus red numbers for India (left pair of hex numbers) and USA (center pair of hex numbers). Is plastic construction between the rings in Europe and USA ? But, then again, no clear answer.

To answer my well belated question, yes, they are BREEAM Make lower density eaic rim ( anyway deno-dense) in a variety of designs, tip-to-tail (lobby for example), and eventually three-layer eaic rings (table top)

hybrid between Hyperdense mid taper and Hypershort taper shapes; with some through-the-box design.

The fundamentals consist of ring size not barely exceeding the outer spacer, AND sound reduction for cushioning.

and thinner micrometer; and could include a stylus layer for flexibilites

"Simple" TV-KickSpider microtip; some sort of single-coil; mono to stereo in a pinch

Fibreglass, single-fibre; Nichrome wire; Hyperdense tips. Not quite normal ceramic but the "Ceramic" photos on azurite stumbler is somewhat misleading; Ceramic should be coated with aluminum dioxide... or based like it in glass resin.

But, everything is removable. Yes, in a few weeks we hope the ninja generation will bring out single strip/connector based V-SLRs instead of triple-strip. :) In addition manufacturing few hundred at a time would be convoluted.

Ahd Eric could spare me a company shop concept - that shows .. maybe a display window for input/output impedance, current and Cathode voltage...

May og not cost this much. Could be in more precision applications. But could come with ports diffrent from single pin bidirectionality inside configuration (that miscalibrates current; which must be cured by a high current pattern across the tip. "Nontheless we experience "actual" balun behavior it seems more like unsteroidal)."

"Ceramic" or High speed Poisson pendulum?

Correct kind of flexibility but miscalibrates current.

The Internet of Things could help retailers save 25 percent to 30 percent by controlling what they sell by simply watching consumers in store.

by Christian Aka Sørensen

As a former marketer, I've seen the impact of technology-enabled platforms and how big brands leverage them to integrate more services into their operations and ultimately lift their brands as they do so.

I'm bullish on the potential of the Internet of Things (IoT), too. As more consumer devices and more data are generated and e-commerce dollars flow in, the IoT plays an increasingly significant role in the digital marketplace.

At least, that's what we're seeing now in some parts of the world with all of its potential benefits. A of companies in Sweden, Denmark, and Germany say that buying a pack of tubes and watching your cheese at the same time has the potential to save you as much as 25 to 30 percent on your cheese. Or even you, if you're an Australian entrepreneur.

In Denmark, YouGov from January's Euromonitor Consumer Design Expo saw that you could make up to half of the value in your home with a TV program, and take your shopping home, and that in Denmark, having your cable TV on for several hours a day can cost even less than a hot lunch. (Cost per Prime return: $0.58.)

YouGov even has a Twitter handle named Denmark Incredible that shows how Denmark is now "impossibly living."

An ironic twist to Denmark's Little gives you half the price of Cheese you can get Online @TheDenmarkInsane … we all love Denmark right, Twitter! pic.twitter.com/MG8qNRSAzW — DENixie Denmark (@digitalextasha) December 2, 2015

"The Danish data — personality notes, interest ratings, shopping habits, and more — can be used on a popular e-commerce platform and can be personalized based on your specific shopping patterns," said DAB Robotics, the world's first robot-driven 3D printer producer, on their creation.

'Never underestimate your customer's intelligence. It will come home and make a cheese sandwich for you,' someone says, mocking Drake's Rhymes. — Kevin O'Leary (@kevinolearytv) October 22, 2014

Some more evidence of the potential benefits of this emerging technology can still be found across the world.

Some e-commerce operators, as well as a number of retailers believe that e-tailers in Mexico could potentially save 25 percent to 30 percent by using mobile and weaving distribution more seamlessly on site.

Additionally, with smart TVs and easier will getting more connected devices, companies like Netflix and Audible could run a potential savings of $.99, 2.97–4.97 percent each. And a retailer could save up to $.45 ($.81) on customers purchasing items with Amazon Prime, a membership program that, according to a research by research firm Forrester, generates an overall effect of $14 to $17 for being bought and the $2 merchandise savings.

An Offer In Kind

According to Marcel Anderan, a licensed Certified Financial planner, e-commerce is also having a impact on within-venue sales, honoring withholding taxes generally added to sales finance. As he told me, this is the basis of the e-services certification that many retailers cite last time going to the SEC in 2013.

E-commerce retailers like Costco, Target, Walmart, and Wm. Hulbert Co. have called Washington Waltham into an IRS hearing to chat with you about a service that we call receiving third party payments to keep medical costs in check. (Forrester, $15 billion Endpoint partnership)

Copycats stealthily entering the contract marketplace peek their head up out of this cave, considering that only 4% to 10% of products creating trades are bought through far margin contracts rather than outright purchases. The blanket business that neither half should accept is desperate, because in more than 15% of cases, items under the budget that aren't backed by a standardized fund is eroded onto other parts of business or finances. That income stream is no longer secure for self- restaurant or photography company, either. This form of weak, not much, growth of your business is taking 12–15 cents off your earnings for every time you spend a company rounding up and receiving third parties payments, accumulating information that confirms to you that you're not only a deception, you're a cheater.

So after all these 12–15% of businesses, self-produced to balance shelves for 9 hours a day and offer daily specials and advertisements, and write checks to friends and family business but have no defenders settle down, where will the next potential batch of midlife crises come from?

And as we continue to create more of our web content hemorrhaging the first 6 to 12 weeks thanks capacity things get compromised at major content platforms such as Ask Jeeves

Best My Best

It's a relief that it's over. In his first season with the Leafs, James van Riemsdyk said it was not just "a learning process" but a regression. When the team went on a long run in November, that's the type of talk he asked to hear. Now it's all looking back to that. In van Riemsdyk, the Leafs have perhaps the best (budget-wise) second-line center available. Off days are about to become less frequent. Which leaves the whole hypothetical Maple Leafs taking a step back in the standings with another top-six winger. He is also now almost two full minutes shy of his career high in assists, but with the 2016-17 season less than halfway finished, we should expect triple digits now. How do we like our play?

Career zashin: JVR

Real Curve: 16ater Days, 6TD, +463, 4v5 Goals

Stepengränk: I wasn't around the Leafs last year during the stakes/training camp weeks, and it doesn't mean anything in the grand scheme of things that a million fans across the planet were unable to get tickets to (laughs). But I have to say that leaving James van Riemsdyk in the lineup was a letdown for so many. Honestly, even this team still had reason to feel heartbroken over the prospect going to Puerto Rico, but here he is. And in Smith, expect the former second overall pick to make Maple Leafs History again. Punching out a five figure spot isn't surprising, but I didn't expect his top line to be that good. Once he gets out to play six minutes a night at center, he could very well deliver that sort of output. And speaking of health, he scored on his first shift of the season.

Stepengränk: Most of the league – including a couple of Leafs past's – really 'hoped' for depth. They wanted more governance arrangements between their round-six guys and many asked why not showcase a pair on the Leafs blue-line in their preferred roles as a representative season. I interpret this in the sense I wanted him to experiment on this team, and at present he is too great a fit for strictly installation as a vital factor. And I'll begin the rambling debate on the plus/minus: it was, objectively, This Year's Much-Buzzed-About Total with this type of talent, but we couldn't explain the near-perfect season so far. It takes time for that to become reflexive; you see it's in goonsered history, but its meant on principle. There is some confusion on the stat – how can you assign the rating of 'game' business as actual Oiler hockey over a 50-minute performance when this isn't a 0-0 game, but a game in an ugly salleaf of a middocker and routart stages? Tale of rounds repeated, oh, now it's 4-2 ‒ in our fantasy game this is 2/3 days later.

Real Curve: 17ater Days, 7G, +526, 3v5 Goals

Stepengränk: I didn't keep an eye on the Little Show, but this season's reconnaisance is amazing. He is on his way to perhaps delivering what he did to the White Leggoys. When games become truly significant for Toronto, it will become much easier for him to control the time he's on the ice. Mark Mothersbaugh's '30 minutes' storyline is SO INVEST Secure (hashtag Rhagycially Nuked) ‒ that one hit from van Riemsdyk, in half a season, is being compared to Deroun Riddler's supposed hatching plot. Gee, a 'sneakie' versus 'ramming'… it's rare, but it happened in the playoffs last year. Jonas called it out. Safe to say Healy is going to get a proper look soon. We all like both, well played.

======================================== SAMPLE 126 ========================================
Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced Monday that six police officers had been arrested for allegedly framing 18-year-old Freddie Gray for whole-cloth stealing a $5 from a police officer. The Baltimore Police Department called Mosby's announcement a "cover-up." It sounds like it. The statement released by Mosby's office from today, where all the restraining order fraud was launched, sounded like 21 days of an earnestly hyped soft-pedaling of scandal for a victim that wasn't, in fact, guilty of stealing a slice from a civil servant's wallet.

***UPDATE 4:17 PM: Baltimore police say from where they shot 24-year-old Freddie Gray—not in the back and not when he was restrained by the police—interviews from both officers could help lead to the men charged in the case being held accountable for their actions. "There is evidence that another member of the Street Crime Unit chased and tackled and was approximately 17-24 feet from the deceased prior to police arrival," the BPD said they want evidence to support that statement. They are apparently looking at the video of officials urinating on a casket.

***UPDATE Noon EST: At a press conference, Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said that the physical evidence on the scene of the fracas but that they were waiting on medical reports before making any reports or commenting on the report that Freddie Gray somehow injured himself while being transported to the hospital.

Yes. Nine or ten days ago, the Baltimore Police Department thought this insane version of events—an overweight victim with blocky peanut butter-brown eyes flailing around on the floor and a madman peering out from an elevated walkway that one either unarrested officer originally excused—would hold together a bumpy ride for them in meaningfully investigating the murder of a young man. One thing didn't hold together that hideous ragtag stack: bigger picture.

Cops told the New York Times they believe Gray performed CPR and was shouting for help in the hospital, despite all zero medical staff in the incorrect currency of seconds leading to his untimely death. Two medics rushed to The Citadel Hospital where he was admitted a mere five minutes later after it was hammered by riots and protests. He'd tell a nurse he was feeling better and was departing?

Once wounded, Gray's cuffed hands were moved to a garbage cart where they remained for fifteen minutes before being discarded in the garbage disposal. There were two individuals roaming in the area outside of the install who watched a suspicious person dispose of his dead body. Pictures of the double-helicopter sweep of the remains led to questioning of at least seven different bystanders who did not see the entire thing. Some of them played dumb and were—in all likelihood—convinced Batts and other top brass.

***UPDATE 5:56PM EST: The Batts statement containing all this craziness:

Since this morning, the City of Baltimore and the City's police department have been working diligently and cooperatively to resolve the investigation into the death of Mr. Gray. The efforts so far have been gratifying, but they have not been sufficient to resolve satisfactorily the officers involved, nor have they made us whole. We have continued to be open and transparent throughout the entire process because we believe it is ultimately in the best interest of justice to ensure that the public has the full and accurate record of our actions and other elements of this tragic event.

And continuing, BPD officials are not covered by the restraining order fraud.<|endoftext|>While it's tempting to look upon Yahoo's last few years of failure as an inevitable product regression being dragged along by a greedy acquisitions department, and thus inevitable price hikes, look at it this way: Whatever Yahoo did turning over a new leaf back in 2012 – bringing the price of a realized $70+ billion company down below $25, trips Latin America for a drastic price reduction last November; and making a steady series of four acquisitions in the past 18 months – ended up with a new, higher priced operating profit margin in 2013, and a much needed trip into the black late last year.

Which means the acquisition merry-go-round will go on as usual for awhile, we just really need to work on not talking about it.

That might not happen though, as last night, during the company's earnings call, Yahoo Chairman Marc Andreessen had this to tell the company's "new transformation adviser," former Google VP Richard Hayne:

"The fundamental reason we're cautious for now, I think, is our rate of long-term capital spending remains very slow, so that's the thing that's motivated me."

Some will think it's impossible that Andreessen could be factored into a renewal of Google's overture, but consider this: There's a market for 1) Wearables and 2) Messaging Ideas and we're clearly in a dream role for engineer to construct killer, next-gen products that address both /Google

The new apartment complex will be partly funded via a $50,000 grant from the Center for Responsible Lending

Coney Island residents are gearing up to submit construction bids to renovate the 100-year-old apartment complex into their dream home. The New York City Housing Authority is donating $50,000 to pay for the work, which will include new kitchen cabinets, windows, and lighting as well as an improved bathroom.

"Right now," said Adam Root, the Center for Responsible Lending's (CRDL) Chief Project Officer, "there's no place for seniors to retire." According to the CRDL, there are no retirement communities in either Coney Island or Sheepshead Bay, N.Y.

Responding to elderly curiosities, the roof of the vacant building will be covered with Realtor's wall tarp to act as an LED retro-fit, as well as use wood-sourced paint to replace tile, and purchase items for the home with proceeds from the new Coney Island Apartments.

"This innovative program offers residents the opportunity to invest in a new building their own way and participate in helping build a strong local economy." said Tonya Plytorik, New York City Housing Authority Director, in a press statement. "We think this plan will deliver really exciting results and have learned a lot from this early phase of CRDL's partnership with the New York City Housing Authority."

GROUND PLANS: New space to facilitate museum-like surroundings coalesces in advance of NYC's Capital ID project

The 13,600-square-foot site, on the corner of 30th Street and Broadway, features many small exchange buildings including Abbe's department store, creditors Cuddz, and Jamesism," and a factory for cheap new stones.

'Although originally integrated with the harbor, Coney Island has always been the final destination for thousands of mail officers and phone operators to retire,'said Brick building owner, Donna Daley. "When we bought this building in the middle of the last century, there was nothing here to take their place." Now, along with Coney Island Apartments, the brick factory, homes, and surrounding industrial parking lot constitutes landing shape with parks planned on the property as well as new parks off the Broadway-side waterfront.

Building update: The 11-story landmark building is demolished to make way for new park along the Williamsburg waterfront

Snapping on ideas, small businesses have joined forces to formulate what is arguably the city's most extensive redevelopment plan to date. Consider Foodcorncharlie.as, led by entrepreneur Phil Daentz, which is transforming a former former Rye Deli into the Rocky's Café, a one-stop-shop for just about everything tradeable. "We address business requirements for an Arab Gourmet coffee shop, school cafeteria, deli/snack bar, Italian food…" They're building the business right next to the refrigerated warehouse area, which will eventually be operable for out-of-town customers.

METRO: Exterior of in operations replacement of selected Wall Street station

Popular local taco company, TLDA Catering, is aiming to open its first Farm to Markets location. His burger company, Doughboys, is on the hunt for locations for its new catering and food truck parks on Mt. Vernon Parkway, Richmond Avenue, and West 29th Street in Allerton. Combined, they already hold four out of the five metro stations being demolished to make way for the East Side Access project, which will provide subway access to a third track.

The soap opera finale for South Park may have ended with Cartman and his classmates gonna the school carnival to celebrate beating their stupid middle school enemies by evil minions. Soon after, it appears the show might take a more consequential turn this upcoming season.

According to new stage directions, 20/20's pending Season 21 will deal with economic anxieties in as soon as one week, presumably focusing on the devastating economic collapse currently spreading across a number of American cities. This announcement suggests that a possible Season 22, depeding on Cartoon Network demanding additional episodes rather than a breaking news announcement of the group's disbandment, may indeed — shocker — be burdened by issues more important than just cloning the last time they saw the school's vice-principal desperately trying to cover her eyes with a bag into the air of her vagina, then trying to leave the school to join her sawdust queen oligarch husband in an exotic vacation resort at the same time.

Current casting calls (now signed off by both the actors andComedy Central mandated re-writes) specify that a "flashback" episode 22 (perhaps titled "Future Stockman") will focus on Donald Trump, which may or may not catch up with the animators' initial plans to go back to 1986 and 1994. They finally settled on 1996 to coincide with the launch of Trump's 1996 venture, Trump Steaks.

By all accounts, the unscripted show that the producers have been crafting between episodes 13 and 23 has progressed (if only very academically!) since 2011 when it evolved from a set of four shorts into a complete episode. It's no secret that behind the scenes, longtime co-exec producers Alec Berg (106° Farenheit Rudy's Pizza) and Matt Stone (Enters The Mind Of… The Amazing Race!) have been getting more and more involved in the series' episodic proceedings as well, as they adjust to a new proscenium show-running dynamic.

It couldn't come soon enough. During their highly-successful freshman run, the mini-series gamed parody of South Park kicked off massive popular gusts each time, believing itself able to rattle political correctness and foreign policy with crooked twin spinoffs of bankers in Zion and unemployable multi-millionaires covered in balloons. They proved so successful, that the Idea Factory even debuted a rumored series for HBO as a prequel to the series, but the time allotted for the pilot proved prohibitively high, ruining the potential payoff.

With only so much dirt to cover the subject matter of South Park, maybe it shouldn't be surprising that the creators are now re-evaluating the reboot for a more mature 20/20 series. The previous material drifted to Springfield, with every bit that was said in parody missing a useful connotation from reality. Considering current events around the world, the American demographics, the financial crisis, and various other social crises, a similar excursion to a relevant storyline is arriving sooner than expected.

South Park may not be the only media property on the block that will be shaped more by its agenda than its target demographic. Although it has already re-emerged on cable network Comedy Central following its Adult Swim cancellation, the only ongoing iterations of Seinfeld and Friends to deal with a dopey group of primary school kids are in need of balancing egos, demanding fans, and your regular viewing hours.

Still, a continuation of the medium's beloved magical educational meme could be far less hideous than many of the alternatives. Maybe those glassblowers, machinists, and think tank types will finally arrive at Springfield's endless test assembly line for 16 more episodes of nerdy watched terror. Considering their demon-possessed gifts, there might even be some unseen Edward Norton in the cast.

South Park will return to air on September 16th. The 2017/2018 season premieres on Comedy Central in the autumn of 2016.

Matt Jones gave the Sam Houston State University students just what they requested, yet still they had questions about the team. He explained that the quarterback relies on self-study to give a one-on-one impression while Smith taps out answers on paper and designs offensive and defensive plays.

Jones' newest development? He has a message for receivers as he remains adamant their responsibility is to catch the ball.

"The receiver still has to make plays," Jones said. "Personnel isn't the biggest thing. It's making plays of your own. More than anything, that means you support downfield or catch the ball. If we need and we want to punt, we will punt, but the player still has to catch the ball."

As an up and coming recruit for SMU, Jones would rather it weren't all about the football.

He spends his free time out on the swimming pool and beach while also taking part in his high school's local Track and Field team. He also attends night school during the week after his game for homework help. It's not an easy life, yet Jones has earned respect coming from the highest in SMU.

"I think he's incredibly talented and has a lot to offer. He's intelligent, physically strong, great footwork. He has the same type of burst as Carson (Wright)," SMU head coach Chad Morris joked after receiving attorneyales from the Waco native this spring.

Jones has his work cut out for him trying to turn Tennessee Head Ball Coach Jeremy Pruitt's maximization formula to some semblance of life on the field with the Vols. Feel free to comment below with your thoughts.<|endoftext|>'Roar' theatrical trailer ahead of UK premiere

During a recent year-end press tour, FUNimation announced its plans to close out the year with two films for its Sailor Moon and One Piece brands.

"Roar" stars Caitlin Glass as Rito, actress Rani Kosaka plays Midori, and singer Mariko Suzuki punishes the crowd before her singing performance. Screenplay work by high school students Makoto Shinkai and Chiaki Konaka and animated by studio 4C began crafting 1964's original failure

into "a blockbuster phenomenon," and will be presented exclusively domestically in the U.K. and Ireland from February 26-May 2, 2015. It is directed by Ryutaro Nishiura (Endride, Your Lie in April), with animation production handled by A-1 Pictures.

In "Roar," Rito joins Ruka, Usagi, Luna and Makoto on an adventure into the depths of the world's oceans to save Sailor Uranus and Luna, who disappeared while attempting to bring submarines back to Earth. First Seen the Golden Future Cup tale "Sailor Moon" debuted in Japan in 1984 with Sailor Moon on Action in 1987. More recently hinted at return royal action with Team Finland in the latest movie.

Makoto Shinkai and Takeshi Obata also penned the original story, which Shinkai said he immediately loved, and is thrilled that the world it came from will be brought back for the first time in years.

Intelligence experts have spotted Chinese ex Linux malware pouring into computers and PCs across the world, with countries like Russia, Georgia, Israel, India and Ukraine taking the brunt of the infections.

The malware is the newest and most advanced version of China's Stuxnet malware, which has affected Iran, Iraq and Syria, energy sector anochronous, the UK's foreign systems board, Saudi Arabia, a hard drive maker and several banks. It has been under development for over a year and a half, and was released some time in the last two weeks, among other infections.

The creator of the malware, codenamed "Element115", is believed to have invented the same type of malware used by the US and Israel in their covert cyber attack operation on Iran's nuclear program by code name "Olympic Games".

According to a WikiLeaks Vault 7 email - which noted that a French hacker nicknamed "pwnsauce" had written a report of what he called "Great Russian Spying" against Europe and the US - the malware is believed to have been part of the Snowden files obtained by the whistleblower.

Security experts who have analysed the new Chinese malware say that over 75% of the systems impacted by the malware have been Baidu Tech figures, and that six "weaponized" PCs are believed to be active.

"We identified pieces both of the code that is stored inside the malware and of the associated architecture," Paul McGeough, an independent security academic, told Reuters.

"What's quite unique about this is that it uses a unique architecture indeed, which is related in some way to Microsoft DLL injection or to dynamically generating executable code.

"We do not know enough of the relevant pieces of the firmware and firmware-relevant libraries to claim it is new - it's an old development/revision of previous Linux CodeView malware.

"We suspect the malware is the work of the Chinese government or a Chinese agency who has access to the Southern and Indian Cyber Armies. There's a certain amount of overlap between North and South and they could easily swap around, but we can't get a black-box perspective."

Several countries in the east, including Russia, find themselves notorious as the targets for such malware. It can be used by the Chinese US government to target countries around the world.

India comes in third, but low tech countries like Georgia are the culprits all else being equal. After Russia, advanced countries, like Germany, and, Asian computer factories, such as Taiwan and South Korea, grabbing second and third place respectively.<|endoftext|>Player Comparison Finder: George Hill (2015-16) vs. Avery Bradley (2015-16) vs. Jeff Teague (2015-16)

The central yuan zone is to be opened to China's services sector "very soon" to be completed next year, Fitch said on Tuesday.

The yuan rose 0.24 percent to 6.2122 a dollar at 11:17 p.m. on the Hong Kong stock exchange.

"We are now focusing on the mid-year," Fitch said. With the yuan weakening from around 6.50 to 6.75 per dollar at the start of the year, the market has been tuned to future rate moves.

Germany's youngest ambassador, Peter Wittig, will retire in October, having held his post for only five months.

Short-term protection?

"China is in the middle of implementing a significant rate cut since November 2015 and the BOJ is taking the same approach in terms of the context for tapering by the end of 2017, which would arrive at a similar timing for the yuan," Fitch said.

However, it's unclear how effective the interest-rate cut really is because the pace of the policy is not commensurate with changes in supply and demand.


Banks and other firms are not bracing for large bail-outs in the event of a currency crisis, and large corporations continue to take advantage of low interest rates to balance their books at the expense of their labor force, the central bank said Tuesday in its monthly monetary policy publication.

The central bank said that social and economic safety nets - such as unemployment benefit, child nutrition, childcare and retirement benefits - are sufficient to help families, and that banks are ready to handle easy credit. However, it will continue to shut banks without sufficient reserves over failed banks, state media reported.

China will manage a currency crisis in the same way it handled the 1997/1998 crisis, and properly keep their powder dry, Barclays and HSBC said they each have China-dollar derivatives and are set to obtain more yuan client assets later in Changhua Real Estate E-Works Press conference.

"They should start implementing

But Boulter, a longtime resident of Montgomery Village, said the houses are only occupied to give the owners a sense of neighborhood, and for the help of the artists. Pepon Belton of Music and an avowed "of course it's a secret" member members of Preservation Montgomery recently said while they haven't been in the house in several months that they expect the house to be renovated in the next few seasons.

Tomasello, Mount Vernon Park resident since 1980, said that most are becoming less active often. Nelson, who purchased one house in recent years, hasn't been there for a not too long time, he said.

But new faces have joined the group. Rosaniy will be serving as whatever the house is occupied by, Nelson said. Jacqueline Kreeger, University of Maryland graduate student, posted on a community page a few months ago that she's under the impression the house is a redundant house, and that she wants to "go elsewhere forever."

Braas, another University of Maryland graduate student, said earlier this month that she has been there of many years and she hopes to contribute to the project that she has been told is a possible renovation.

"They've been doing this long enough. Before, you walked by and said hi then, now it's basically a bunch of strangers," Braas said, gesturing for lighter cigarette smoke to drift at her. So like Braas a number of times throughout the course of the hod when a passing car rolled up to pass her on the street corner, or when she observed the group walking down the street sometimes, Braas was confused by the names the strangers of the house kept using in conversation. "I keep calling them. Nobody answered. How do you know which one is who?"

Braas on Wednesday also asked about the potentially sinister aspects of the event that can be a recurring feature of this kind of neighborhood meet-up. Kaliel Rice, who lives in the same home as Braas, communicated her desire to remove this particular hypothetical, which could vaguely pertain to the legalities, as soon as possible. "I'm scared," she said apologetically.

Sitting each in a chair in the beautiful bedroom, including the smaller nook where Belton could always hop on another bed if he desired without being pushed against the chest of drawers, Nelson discussed the archives of the event. Three times a year since 2008, he explained that friends of members book their vacation plans to visit Unity with the intention of meeting up in the house that week.

The residents at the front of the house have met the monthly dates previously, five had visited the remainder, and few of the remaining have missed it. "7 tracks, drums, ghost participants, head high unnerving squirrels -complete frustrating otherness notedis -highly addictive. Brilliant." Nelson said as he put down his martini. "Chills."<|endoftext|>"Human dignity claims were lost in this massacre, and hundreds of lives were lost, families devastated, and an already fragile community traumatized.

George Grootslang, France's lead goalkeeper, won the Fifa Puskas Award for Goal of the Tournament as he came up against the Greek defender Kostas Mitroglou.

Austria coach Andi Herzog ranked Mitroglou in the top five goalkeepers in the world, ahead of Manchester United's David De Gea as well as Simeone's Atletico Madrid and Gianluigi Buffon.

Grootslang's smartly played free-kick had already put France ahead but was only recognised for his goal in the 87th minute.

Other names from the relatively shortlist, including Buffon, De Gea and Legia Warsaw's Mateusz Dicko, were omitted from the event film after they stepped aside to allow for movie-makers to make up the shortlist of 27 names.

The total distribution of footage will be up to his players after Sky Sports will show a large slice of clips of Albania's World Cup qualifier January 31 against Macedonia at the Odeon Arena in Cardiff.

The exclusion of Dicko triggered accusations of match favouritism by Roberto Martinez and Howard Webb, the England manager, respectively, with Sky Sports replying that McClaren would have assured it was also put to the players or they would have walked out.

On August 5 and 6, Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz squared off in their last debate before Nevada's Democratic Caucus. The two candidates held slightly different opinions on a variety of issues (Sanders by far favored the ERA and inflationary monetary policy). However, I decided to look at trends within the two candidates' positions. I then used the examples that popped into my mind.

Bernie Sanders

The first Republican Candidate whom Bernie Sanders significantly disagrees with is Ronald Reagan in 1982. His highest support was in favor of reforming the Food Stamp program. Reagan was perfect in that he understood the problems that arose during the Great Society and his support of the food stamp program proved to be a wise policy for two reasons: Sanders side was always going to be far ahead at that time. The second reason is that Reagan understood that poverty in America was spiraling out of control due to rampant liberalism in bureaucracies and just overall past mistakes that needed to be cleaned up to make other people's lives a little bit better.

Way into the 1980s, socialism and liberalism flourished because they could both articulate the same left-wing socio-economic message. Clinton supporters who say Bernie Sanders supporters are ignorant about politics would answer that this is because their bases of support could not get beyond 79% in that election. This was because everyone had come to believe that policies that failed in the most successful? Democratic Presidency? Ever since they first held credit card wounds, the American people have been convinced that the problem was the Left.

During the entire election season, Bernie Sanders took 60% of votes compared to Hillary's 37%. Has support for his proposed SLCC ratcheted up or has it simply been inherently among his base? This is especially true since levels of employment have increased in Vermont. Sanders supported federal funding for health care, college tuition and social security for all. Politicians like Clinton supported no change to any of these three items (minimal alteration).

Notice that in each of these cases, the Sanders side was always ahead in the ratings. Obama BEFORE becoming President was a categorically ratings objects: high 80's and 90's compared to the kind of low that Trump is enjoying under the Electoral College.

Voter indexes have not let up once Sanders has been elected President. They were higher in 2008 than they were in 2016. I don't believe that they will be much higher after this year's election. It's incredibly close this time given the dynamics of power and money.

Takeaways: Bernie Sanders took in enough votes this election season compared to Clinton to the point where he has a substantial lead that stubbornly scales alike to Windows versions if we count just by totals from states. In this election, most Americans included (and still include) Sanders side. He will continue to get more votes, but I believe that is largely temporary for the following reasons:

Neoliberals Several promised Middle Class tax cuts: Clinton, however, did not. A 12% corporate rate on foreign strings would have been the highest regulations for virtually every economic sector. Being "the only gripe" that Sanders has got Republicans to talk about is attractive to both parties – D is marginal. Clinton points in it's own direction. Climate change is real given what is going on with temperatures, the knock-on effects for our survival and resiliency, and mortality, but it's not the make or break issue nurses like to controversial Strife with. Hillary can earn his vote from isn't arguing for anything fantastical or speculative but instead talking about the status quo and potential for improvement. More recent Congresses included other things to talk about. Education (N.Y. city promise) Campaign finance reform (Conn. bill) Criminal justice reform (Cpt. Lynch has ordered reforms) Middle class tax cuts IS what creates jobs, create incentives for political growth and create infrastructure for people to actively work for themselves, pay taxes at home, and grow their savings via effective bank account or brokerage service. I vote for Sanders, and conservatives vote for Donald Trump. Logically – I despise Trump, but I hold my nose, pick the lesser of serious political evil and vote for Trump. Bernie is a Libertarian. Laws that punish choice have never helped anyone in the end and never will. That is why gun ownership doesn't seem to be an issue to Sanders supporters, nor is invasive medical marijuana. Hillary Supporters contact me when they want to get marriage of love, but financial justice is more important to Hillary. Hillary wants to put a man's prison lights to even members trips. She studiously avoided the military industrial complex in support of Hillary, which will not make me look good to a friend whom I respect.

Solar power and mountaintop removal coal mining have the potential, under Trump's EPA, to end the use of the volume of electricity used for the nation's transportation fleet and plant could use waste-to-energy plants to bring that electricity back into the grid.

Going solar in the US has grown significantly over the last few years, thanks to the adoption of various forms of solar batteries for home, commercial, and government installations. After battery prices were cut in half by Tesla, it would look like a no brainer. But now, with the cost of solar designed to get cheaper each year, should coal and natural gas continue to be a closer and more profitable alternative, it may be time to stop using fossil fuels for transportation in favor of more solar power.

Source: Department of Energy For solar energy to scale away from fossil fuels, useful operating conservations are required. These are particularly hard to achieve in coal and gas plants subject to intermittency. However, a number of opportunities for capturing waste heat from the generation of electricity from solar have partially mitigated possible disruptions from intermittent generation. For each kilowatt-hour of installed solar, waste heat, in the form of hot water from last summer's world record 12-day sun or hot exhaust gases from burning certain coal roots tools, can be redirected from growing new coal or gas generation to cooling these plants and utilizing other power-generation resources.31 For example, by 2012, several hundred U.S. plants had transitioned to capture and consumption systems to regulate power output following cascading systems failures with no net cooling of the system.- Four times quicker than the average associated disasters while still subject to declaration of at-risk status.32-

These recycling systems are utilized for what the DOE does (not that it needs to restart them either, but well) as well as one other for better, you guessed it: electricity.31 The latter activity, recycling, means that great amounts of energy can be retained for uses that can be disposing of and recovering during periods when there is more renewables being produced. The extent to which these systems work is unknown, but the basic idea is to take the heat to consume it in much of the renewable electricity produced, which could convert from the renewable energy (renewable to derived in the case of solar and wind) that is produced.

One example would be to take the generated electricity and use it to drive a hot water heaters to remain heated and save electricity from increased demand for power and stream heating.33 Additionally, some this technology is 'fossilized' in new plants, but use happens on an old planting.34 Typically a less efficient plant can be converted, and after a couple years they can be phased out according to the way a new plant is operated.49 This allows power for increasing electric cars across the country. Different industries could choose to convert those kinds of power to meet specific needs.

Transportation systems are the biggest cloud of being in just about any shortage of power because of intermittent source, which is somewhat ironic considering how great most green tech companies are on the potential for their shared services and products being used for warming the world.

Airports fuel and electricity losses themselves make them simple targets in renewable energy, access to electricity generation technologies that consider rising costs and benefits.41

A busy SFO airport can generate that much electricity even during summer, one of the hottest months in the US. In short, if a national catastrophe were to occur and reliability of the US electricity grid recovered from its current situation, rooftop solar plants and savings of vehicular power carbon wasn't the answer homed.


Solar sites could be retrofitted to include recharging capacitors along with the panel, relocating the power connection to produce more air conditioning for those plants. Then. It seems that while electric cars do not want any more coal plants are innovating other ways to meet the electricity needs of industrial producers.

Wind and solar plants don't have the capacity to ramp plant operation during times with low power in the US and would feel outmatched by the hydro canc Western utilities can offer. So for now large generators may continue to choose to burn coal and throw into the waste heat. Among Thomas A. Joyce Senior Fellow Kathryn Yost, and I believe her husband, which has been doing sand and potash mining in the United States for 30 years, are topics that could inquire the energy use savings.


Wind and solar plants in the US have been produced for natural gas as well. With major advances in renewable technology, the 300 megawatts installed nearby could serve for transportation in place of having natural gas power plants since well-to-wheels and moving the job and slide troops could reduce costs and speed the development potential of fuel.

Because these power plants can reduce energy needs to a fundamental level, they would collect power from the wind, solar, and even the newly discovered faster flowing natural gas migration form that range of energy. To obtain more of this cheap power, companies might end up

Background information Edit

Huala was played by Jacqueline Kim.

Melanie Hiller worked with Kim on the pages of Voyager's Totally Spaced out issue #33, "The Tunnel" section. [3]

In an interview, Kim indicated that, when designing Huala for "The War Game", she drew her first impression from a picture they had of a cute lizard-like creature, doing the dojax dance for her, and that Kim drew her design after noting to herself, "It looks like the same creature." [4]

The Big Bang Theory actor David Schwimmer is helping to promote a Jeremy Corbyn art project in Leeds.

The 44-year-old actor, whose alter ego is Professor George Lott/Ed Miliband, has lent his voice to a new play called 'DATA'.

Set in South Yorkshire in 1983, it is about people whose rights were lost at the time as a result of collusion between GCHQ and the 1981 law restricting copyright in comedy live material.

The star will appear in a 10-minute video visit to see the show on Friday.

Peter Kay has recently bought the rights for the play to allow the play to be staged here.

Green, rich

Citizens Against Copyright Theft, an anti-piracy outfit, have backed the play's Edinburgh Museum trip, to be staged at the same time the Big Bang Theory comes to the Capital Theatre for its run next month.

Princess Elizabeth's HMC, which was a music hall on the London Underground for more than a century, is the subject of the play.

One of the film stars of the era, George Lott was also a comedian; his hit show distributor C.model Buzz promoted Action for Music. Now Sir Tony Hall, joint winner of the 1982 International Emmy and Billboard magazine Personality, is helping to rescue these rights for future generations.

The Labour leader of the Leeds city council is also co-authoring a book "featuring stories on intellectual property from Labour government".

"Experience you have will inform the ideas you act on," the book's cover page reads. "It is only constructive adaptation that creates credibility in knowledge."

======================================== SAMPLE 137 ========================================
Killers' Village in Long site in South Vietnam, at the time an American- and South Vietnamese-occupied area, had the world's biggest massacre

A decade later the village is filled with locals trying hard to convince their North Vietnamese tormentors that this is the place to kill Giacomo Crimi, their Foreign Legionous commander. Few are holding their peace-loving gatherers of crops.

Crimi's murder carries a frightening echo. On 6 October 1960, American paratroopers had wired him to give them the address where the vicomte of a Rice patch called Mung Hoang was holed up. They fired 32 machine guns and packed into the My Lai massacre the props that the soldiers used in Zaw Htun, including a freshly cut grass slit from the base of a large young cherry tree, a defining symbol of its milieu.

The shoot-to-kill policy handily defeated the local Thai military leaders, who had been committed to ending the Vietcong coercion and kidnap of the trappings of North Vietnamese power, as well as to offering genuine relief to a million soldiers. After the shooting in the My Lai canal, the terrified Vietnamese on both sides ran home to tell their leaders.

From then on, they would shoot one another over the revenge gambit that had won the freedom-seekers the Phuong brothers' quarterback, the football team's starting quarterback, as well as cinematographer Q Lee, the minister of defence, and the newspaper director. They also won Napalm Girl, the movie starring Marlon Brando, but this battle of wills would not die with those names. That was against the reign of the country's nationalist chief of staff, and it was a confusing and poor way of ending a glorious and imaginative victory, but it is still remembered as the best the country has ever used to demonstrate the enduring power of surrender and the restraints of the Vietnam War.

Eyes narrowed

Minister of War Phung Quang named a new chief of staff, Duong Van Minh, and set him to build as much normalcy as he could within the constraints of war. So what did one expect when enlisting the new chief's aide, curtsying to him as they left headquarters, generally giving a thumbs up to passers by?

The explanation must apply to some of us too for, as paratroopers, we were asked at the end of whatever we did, we were automatically assigned the peace symbols: no pushcarts in the Ho Chi Minh Trail through Hanoi, the flowery coffee and more hot dogs on enemy-occupied seats of government than anyone will ever know about. Our surrender really was that, for once, ordinary life would be more important than guns, rivers of blood or gods.

As it turned out, morale was astonishingly high. In such a long war, troops are not expected to think, much less to hold hands and anticipate loved ones. Thirteen years after they surrendered in a start-up paroxysm of pain, now that would have been brash. Veterans, the media and the demobilised divisions all assumed that there was just about a 75% chance their people would meet basic tolerances of sea information, import cones, nutrition, basic freedoms or accommodation.

It was expected that, by now, the losses should show even by now that the hated War Heavenly Warriors that most of Singapore had flown out to Moscow to fight at nose-seriously were no match for Americans fighting in the same country. 50,000 days would have passed, they thought, before they would be happy.

Surely, surely not.

By about 1957, with the intense attempts to denigrate and humiliate the Bo Giao Gang ­ and naval corsairs that guarded it ­ those assumptions could hardly be looked at seriously; 60,000 days after landing in Asia they were rubbish. will indeed be happy. Where then were they most tortured, ostracised, humiliated?

Then, as now, the figures were the destruction of geography, the cost and rising mortality of private property. When the men in the village realized what a disaster they had made of their new South Vietnam by bulldozing their ancestral homeland just metres down the road they felt they had been unjustly deprived of their birthright.

There was no recourse available except retaliation. Villagers deliberately massacred elders of Bo Giao Gang tribes, proceeded across the bridge and out to the border where they could also sexually harass fleeing women.

When discord was bad, they ripped mangroves down to expose burnt provinces, set fire to imperial hovels. When Mang Hiept sent the prisoners in his territory into us, the unit, who positively relished the middle aged in isolation, flushed them down the roads. This was after Kol Tek experienced three hour battles with enemy crab deserters, swearing all day and daring not to sneeze at any mention of Khe Chu.

I've argued several times again that in an economic revival, too much emphasis is placed on permanent absolutes that are doubtful, and too little on the TBTF convenience fo yesterday's security problem

This relates quite directly to two seemingly unrelated points:

The song "Keep On Beating" by ABBA (by far my most favorite song) is about a woman reading the book of Proverbs and taking it literally. The main theme of the song is to follow one's mind. The next lines comment, "Tell me Er 20 a right, surt out on yo gui a leyl, keep that zo," which may refer to what Paul refers to as "binary decision making," less an actual binary matrix than a divisive concept known as "catch-22." I heard some evidence in The New Yorker a couple months ago that shortly after 9/11, the optimal response to another terrorist attack would have been to seek out a Tim Hortons, which was driven out of business in the mid-90s due to continuous protests because of their fluffy bean lattes made it difficult for female drivers to get home safely on airplanes. I maintain that the optimal response to wonkish political gridlock would be to make Liberal Matt Chinglin a Vice President for Illinois, which would free up his time to come up with absolutely disgusting, awful, unconstitutional, stupid, elitist, power-hungry policies that will never, ever, happen.

The fact that limited physical infrastructure isn't lacking in the history of man is one of those quiet, infinite, and deeply familiar truths that creates trouble when you try to enforce it more rigorously.

A more formal example of Breitbard's feasibility constraint can be seen by looking at lower levels of civilization. In deterministic biological theories of evolution, like Darwin, we assign no more power to organisms lacking external input or intermediates from outside of their species or environments (which makes evolutionary reasoning an inhuman process). As I've argued many times before, the linear progressions of biological complexity (like passing on small changes without taking in new input) don't make evolutionary much more credible, in that they neglect about 90% of the evolutionary process. That changes constantly because of random variations constantly interrupting the flow of the greater majority of traditional mathematical evolutionary models.

Indeed, most significantly, most biologists are not optimistic that any species will ever achieve a collision with the victory of entropy. Rather, even if we don't expect the evolution of metabolic hardware to be simple or clean, we can assume that the computational complexity of the creatures that exploit it will lower amongst the stars. Those species are literally designs in duct tape waxed with duct tape wax melted in. Quite roughly, we can expect evolutionary complexity to continue lower at *every sky*. More precisely, this pessimism is a result of our emphasis on the uniqueness of life on Earth. As explained in Eris, the animal has an unprecedented advantage in the reduction and inversion of time: being your start software is a different way of handling time than recycling. And, if those problems are onerous, so amenable to waxing they tend to be minimized.

They don't usually grow into stupid Evolution of Incompleteness. (But then, why should they?, given the slab of absurdity that invoked them in the vast majority of my previous arguments?) At the level of generative general temporal syntax, small, smart organisms will show no spiked out indiscernibles blanket accurately mit neither half. Really, Overconstruing These Technically Unjolly Thing must be what makes Asimov a crank, if not a Dark Prince as well. Yes, the Virusians seem to have the perfect onslaught of idiot microbiomes for automated complete sequential processing, but why, I ask, are they so primarily concerned with full completeness like humans are? Any viruses that close wormhole generators or create copies of the particle path do so to avoid collisions (showing excellent transition properties) with the associated civilization planets/military planets. That is, without caveat of overloading wormhole generation or creating copies in the galaxy (the volumetric limit can be programmed on the fly without concern) they can avoid other such forms of collisions that could result in future apocalypse. But probably, other viruses would just prefer to move on to their next hosts. Satisfitting

Shomeon Yuu (音手 ベル)


It's revealed that she likes watching a children's show hosted by Shinkai, as well as Shinkai being lazy. One of her tools is Toraemon ( 石砕猿 ), Professor Shinkai's pet dragon (the other ones are Nebiros/Shimeru and Missoutatsu/Newtorakichi). When given the choice between being used in the cure of Shinkai's illness or help death/slavery, Yuu and Toraemon decide to help Shinkai. However, Yuu ends up becoming a doctor.


During one of the two trials to overcome the curse of the shrine and freeing her brethren, her twin sister Serina came to rescue her. They successfully broke the curse before being blocked by none other than Shinkai who retreated out of Hinamizakura when they got there, causing Yuu to become an "intern" of Shinkai. A long time had passed since then and she did not even remember her twin sister, so she easily takes on his identity with both hacking and origami. After Shinkai's passing she goes by the name Yuu Hida now leaving the curse behind her at the long term. In order to find more power to cure her fellow Twelve's ailment, her ultimate goal is to become a tsukumogami with the three Heavenly Gates and destroy Soul Society and all of humanity with a single turn of the key.[2] Born Yuu Hida also appears several times in the anime.[3] On the anime, she's shown to be madly addicted to the related series Half-Insane (噛みを飛ぶ声宮).[4]

The Freedom Caucus is ready to move on.

House Republicans announced Tuesday morning that they'll soon take the wraps off a new health reform bill that will almost entirely repeal more than a dozen Affordable Care Act regulations, including increased taxes for the rich.

Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), a member of the Freedom Caucus, is responding according to various interviews and statements Tuesday afternoon. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) told reporters he, too, dropped his concern about moving forward without a health reform bill.

Originally, the bill dropped the damaging impact Obamacare regulations have on employer-sponsored health plans. Last week, it changed how many people over the age of 50 and do not have an affordable policy can be required to pay a $750 fine in order to stay on their current plan.

Also by Wednesday, the language for ObamaCare's "public option"—when states will be able to create their own alternative to the Federal Children's Health Insurance Program, replacing Obamacare's small-business and individual markets—will drop.

Watch more!

Republican House leaders have announced plans to whip their bill to repeal major portions of Obamacare, calling it a new start after a long series of failed attempts to repeal the landmark health law. (Alice Li/The Washington Post)

But Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) told reporters Tuesday night and Thursday morning that the Freedom Caucus wants to keep many of the aspects of Obamacare that caused such a ruckus. Republicans say launching negotiations with Democrats could lead to a wave of rejections from 19 Republican-led states given the additional benefits included in the Affordable Care Act that American voters have implemented by signing up for health plans.

These include expanded child-care benefits, coverage for more companies in the individual insurance market, as well as new subsidies that go in excess of the repeal burden to help Americans purchase plans.

Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said, "We can find more money in the AHCA to avoid the crushing effects of Obamacare, and bring health coverage to American families in need."

Critically for Republicans, the replacement bill will maintain "essential health benefits," allowing insurers to charge those with pre-existing conditions more and blocking insurers from charging people with high deductibles.

At Tuesday morning's House Rules Committee meeting, Republican lawmakers are understood to be huddling with some progressive voters in the U.S. Capitol to both rally around their plan and show the Freedom Caucus that it does not favor attacks on crucial constituencies like women, senior citizens and students.

While the AHCA is expected to pass on Friday, some House committees, the Treasury Department and HUD are trying to finalize and debate the passage before Friday.

Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) told reporters that after meetings with President Trump Wednesday, he is "very encouraged" about the Freedom Caucus.

"I spoke with President Trump today, who's a former head of a big corporation. I was very impressed by how he brings a corporate sensibility to the discussion, where he is very focused on completing the legislative process and getting something to President Trump's desk ASAP," Lamborn said. "So he's very energized and motivated about hump day, LR."

Trump even tweeted Oregon Rep. Greg Walden earlier this month on the House tax reform and school funding legislation that Democrats were knocking.

"I was excited to see the Freedom Caucus restore the tax credit in their latest bill to either 510-610/1510," Walden tweeted. "The big tax cut for working class families today!"

I want to thank the @RNCFreedom Caucus for ratcheting up the pressure on leaders to get the House bill passed quickly, and I am encouraged by the results of their recent Capitol Hill meetings.#TaxReform — Greg Walden (@RepGregWalden) December 7, 2017

Walden's son was killed in Afghanistan in November, and Walden holds up the AHCA as a sign of what 2017 will be like for TMI veterans.

Still, there's reason to be discouraged by the process that House Republicans are relishing by putting out the bill—which is still fluid in numerous segments. Reps. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) are working on timers for when a bill will be ready for a House floor vote. According to multiple reports, Reps. Billy Long of Missouri, Barbara Comstock of Virginia and Williams have gotten together to scream.

By Sunday afternoon, three key provisions—the individual mandate, the fund for Medicaid expansion and tax credit extension—were all found to be within reason. Almost all GOP members now seem to accept that 23 million people in the United States with incomes under 300 percent of the federal poverty line are actually going to get some sort of government aid under a new healthcare bill.

This year, the 27-year-old has helped guide his club to the Scottish First Division title in the Scottish Championship, and spearheads the Third Division side of Jambos.

Mackie, who moved from Scottish first team side Queen of the South, Scottish Premier Division champions St Mirren, Celtic and had also played in England for Aberdeen and Reading, is a native of Glasgow who excelled for Falkirk and Airdrie respectively. Mackie came up the ranks for the Columbians, making his full first team debut two years ago at the age of 17. The native of Rosslare, Scotland puts down roots in Columbus as well with possession-loving, attack-minded player linked with MLS from the get go.

"These are very excited for me" said Mackie this morning after joining the team from Morton. "I am excited to finally be here and join the team that has been in Columbus my whole life!" he says.

Mackie started his U.S. Soccer youth career with the U23 CS National team at the University of Akron, but did not play professionally. A college standout with outstanding bay areas division teams like Glenelg and Celtic FC of Scotland, he played in the 2001 AFC Champions Cup and then joined the Scottish Premier League where he played with Dinamo Krakow and for two seasons ,Scotland won the champions cup three times in a row.

Once he caught the eye of Jambos manager Dave Newsham, he stayed in Scotland until the spring of 2005 and embarked on a longish international career that saw him play 4545 times for Scotland, making 5757 appearances scored 35 goals with Olympiacos in Greece, Dundee City in Scotland as well as for Falkirk and Celtic FC. His relief,dagger from 2009/10 Matches and Legends Tournaments in Europe saw him complete his passport after he represented Scotland on 137 occasions representing 65 international goals multiple time champion with Aberdeen (24 goals) and Celtic (16 goals), winning the champions cup twice (2007/08 and 2011/12).

Since joining Jambos, Mackie has seen his playing time increase at a few stops but maintains that the most important thing for him is continuing to score and assist.

"I would like to say thanks to my ajaxassociationjambos for this big coaching job". Sadlordc

With contented and finished 12 games in the Third Division for Barrie Island at age of 27, Mackie signed his first professional contract yesterday with significant selling points on his play throughout the season that direct him to play a major role in Columbus' promotion campaign this year.

Manager Frank Yallop has it as stated that he plans on packing the TSTE's starting lineup with Jamie Mackie and an economic striker off the bench. His offensive style, good passing excellent player at the back, and coaches pacification his defensive positioning are wonders in the long run. The homegrown kid has the blue and red closer than ever before and is looking forward to playing against the venue where he came up and where so many of his family came that's played pro for Canada.

"I thank the Jambos and all the fans, it means a lot to them that they are who they are. … I am blessed to play for a team like Jambos, the supporters are incredible, they are really great and I enjoy every game I play there.

Within 24 hours of Trump's Wednesday endorsement at the Fox Business Network, however, LePage doubled down. In a press conference Friday morning, he reaffirmed his long-held opposition to any mass deportation and his belief that being Latino is a "medical condition," as if repudiating Trump cheers a disease. The response to LePage's pandering had a familiar ring.

Like Trump, LePage selects violations of immigration law as a moral pretext for a racially tinged and unconstitutional range of state interests.

Scientists have found that to help a male white-bellied mouse get laid, a minimum of two female white-bellied mice will be required to provide safe shelter for the cub, which can then become a queen mouse when it grows up.


Mice – and their female fetuses – don't store sperm accurately, neither do they always successfully overpower the semen of other females, a UC Berkeley investigation into the fights carried out among squirrel matings discovered.

An undercover investigation at a Michigan preserve revealed that over 100 separate island groups have been inseminated in one way or another.

The research also found that although females in some groups get pregnant easily, there is much variation among Isle Island squirrels in whether their cubs will pass their genes onto their owners.

For example, in mainland sites even a single orphaned male was highly welcomed, while in the bulk of sites intact-reared females of both sexes regularly laid eggs while producing babies. Females also primped multiple simultaneous primaries, which gave them beautiful Whiskers – much like a brumant Maple for a male.

Researchers studying data from this island habitat search with the help of officers from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, which oversees Isle Shore National Seashore, in cooperation with dozens of local, state and federal agencies.

Researchers have already confirmed and implicated multiple goat attacks overall among island squirrels, but turmoil last November in Kings Peninsula, where the island's largest wild cat population in North America remains at prevalent levels, has prompted island officials to take steps to deny lynx access to the island's western island and to stop culling the island's 375 acres of habitat. Koalas have also been successfully reintroduced to the island's western island.

"Mice appear to be united in their resistance to mammalicides and targeted by parasites. Both groups are certainly disadvantaged, meaning there is a widespread need for a long-term human impact on the island and for natural control, and constructive measures to promote new flows of viable offspring." said NRCS project co-director Keith Coder and lead author Juliette Smith.

Further rhinoceros reductions will help. Studies have shown that longer-lived rhinos run a lower risk from otherwise lethal arthritis drugs, because they will devoted themselves to curbing their own weight as older, wealthier in general rangers do. Over 3,900 native rhinos (Rhinoceros species) were suspected killed from 1994 to 2004, several times the minimum estimate by populations biologists.

The study examined data compiled from mound, hedge and tombstone systems, over which the island squirrels are divided. SUunicipal30 Rosalie Beach surveyors planted 11 kinds of fruit tree fruit trees near the mound, 19 types of nuts in a nestbox, and 47 kinds of flowers across the nine gardens. They then marked these collections with cables. The results of the research appeared in the April issue of the week-long journal of the North American Population Association.

There were appreciable differences of outcome between groups for every research visit. Rhinos were taken in from the marine hearts of two areas well-known as predators; over the course of two years they mustered a meager

Funimation has begun streaming a new original anime video for four individuals who helped refashion the world into the frightening, whimsical fantasia of Marle-chan , the story of the magical childhood friend of Jōichirō Takamachi ( Mushishi , A, Hana , Philosophy, Ryōko ); Aina Suzuki ( Sailor Moon Crystal , School-Live! ) is directing the anime at j.c.Staff , and Misaki Kuno ( Sailor Saturn - Galaxy Sister , Sword Art Online II , DVD-BOX , Knights of Sidonia ) is supervision. .

Four notoriously bigoted individuals dressed as street vendors refused to leave a Toronto church — and were apprehended.

However, the act of painting the anti-gay mural — which read "Pride is not a sidewalk" — didn't end up doing them much good.

"No objection admits the commission of a wilful act to damage, deface, intimidate, intimidate or interfere with the lawful use of property in any manner contrary to section 97 or the generally accepted interpretation or use of section 97," says an application described as a use-of-force notice recently submitted by Toronto police.

A staff sergeant spoke at a meeting before the mural was painted, writing in a document that "proponents of the visual art and those in its queue have immersed themselves into a discourse which engages the flow.... By refusing to leave the Church."

Although not committed to completion of the artwork, the brazen permit permit authors were apparently determined to continue realizing their killer Bad Guy approved artwork. Fortunately, there was video surveillance, which would allow police to apprehend the homeless tent-sellers who refused to leave the Catholic sanctuary.

"Given the exchanges between our six volunteer canvassers, and our police officers, it was clear that the reason the homeless were hurrying to remove the high-visibility paint was that they had no knowledge that the paneling was to be removed - they dismissed it from a Caucasian perspective," writes Christopher Lewis.

Police were assists "by surveillance video that showed instances and instances where now [they] were standing in front of the panel and onlookers asked why the people painted there had installed railings and walked by," Rogers writes. Yet, in fact the homeless people "remain steadfastly refused to comply to a request to actually leave."

Meanwhile, one pastor was also willing to facilitate the 'Rainbow Prayer Procession', chanting along with attendees, as well as offering Mel Toadstedt picnics.

The crackdown began, the pastor said, after some young men in pretzels strolled past with their megaphones wondering when the lawsuit false-flag was going to be flipped the other way.

While pasting anti-"Pride in the name of Satan" slogans on walls is nothing new, the brazen planning of Black Pride —which was also scheduled to be blasted from the outside of Nuit Blanche — made many think the poorly thought out inflatable raft ride in Toronto's Gay Village was a straight-shooter.

But as Toronto police reminded us, however you celebrate, it's about love and acceptance.

Jason, a Toronto resident, picked up and cooked whole pumpkins at his South Central Toronto abode. And one by one, he cradled and nursed them through the night.

The friends lovingly named their accomplishments Beta Beta Bang Bang.

"We picked them up in fresh containers from the local produce stand… and prepared them all ourselves for a total cost of about $20 each," Jason explained on Facebook. "There was a dead pumpkin in the kitchen sink, but I smell like normal dreams," he enviously laughed.

He created each entrails by filling vegetable oil to the brim then focused piercing it with a bright red drills bit. As the pumpkin was cooked for three hours, Jason crammed time in between bites to press the cannoli into its perfect shape.

"Once they were in the pot, they had to sit in the boiling water for 30-40 minutes before we could drink them," Jason added.

After they were done, the kids hung the pumpkin "entourage" by Natalie's maroon ribbon (Yeah its what she got 😉 ). Next week is Halloween. OMG, I can't wait!

The harsh reality facing tea farmers, such as James Martin at Laing Dong Tea Estate in Charkwin, is that and tea is out of the economic fad.


"Within a few weeks of coming out with a new circuit, we were out of Yunnan Tannu," said Mr Martin.

He said the farmers had put unbearable pressure on his connected flush orchestra Bhutan organized heroically to get the tea circuit off the ground back in 2006.

"This gets so tied up in bureaucracy. There is a two-year limit on how long the company can sell it. China has a five-year limit. The company doesn't typically come back for decades. We're chasing, chasing, chasing and the inventory is very low."

"In the U.S., even big traders like Hormel buy about two million bags per year [in their speciality supermarket chain]."

And that's not addressing the woes facing his crop.

Mr Martin notes that's fewer than the planting breakeven of 20.5 kg per tonne here.

But that doesn't preclude the opportunity for high-value lovers of tea to cruise in their flats, as items made of tea have been brought almost to a parity and have sold for as well as or better than they did a decade ago.

But that doesn't mean it can last. While tea waxes and wanes in the market, the lighter varieties such as Pu'er have become more popular under market pressure from the ever-popular T3 brand [Minzhong], mai tai, and Wan Xiao Nan.

But this jostles producers.

Mr Martin said since the Pu'er's in popularity had eclipsed the others "the dust has settled, production has fallen and the market reduced". Mr Peter Lorchey at Cherry Creek Tea in Southern California does see hope.

"On Yunnan brand, new tea companies are joining the fold, a pent-up demand and the Chinese import market are more relevant to local tea," Lorchey said.

"The cultivar technology is up. This year's floral, mid-range T1 has reached a production of 80,000 kgs for the Lincang and comes in a new white tea called Ningxia tea. It's hopped about white/silver coloured leaves."

While concerned tea producers have their eyes on the future, those in the tea industry aren't quite as discerning.

Song Liaohong of the Nature Direct Seeds and Tea Factory plant in Chengdu said he'd been calling in fields this year.

"I don't know what the customer is thinking, there is no demand for it," Song said.

Vendors in the industry aren't as pragmatic as Song, they view There's Such Happiness as a trifle.

Vendors have already taken some profits as they have been selling It's Such A Wonderful Feeling in shops for recent months as it used to be a bit more specialised and in higher volumes, before residents report actual thirsty customers that put it notably in their top list of quick drinks. The shortage shouldn't hamper the good times for the consumers, however.

Besides, it's not uncommon, say those in the industry, to experience longer bean stacks on the crop by mistake.

Until this summer, prenatal testing on gay men was mostly limited to a few research and clinical studies on HIV. But last week, California became the 13th U.S. state to allow men to be tested for their sexual orientation with no influence from any religious or legal entity. New guidelines also make it possible for anyone concerned that a man has been deceived or coerced by a man for sexual activities to request a DNA test. Regulation of the test operator updates your mind when your body is "OK"-ing something.

It's an important piece of modern era testing for LGBTQ people. One of the strongest numbers of people who claim to be LGBTQ is gay and bisexual men, and likely to examine the site for worrisome urine findings. While I'm not one to peruse the Archie McPhee circa 1990s straw dating robot works to pick over sexual curiosity topics, hormones are frightening in complicated ways. Applying trends to people, regarding how we respond to pleasure, and how we interact with health overall, implications of how hormones change are terrifying.

Fox News is currently considered news by many in America, however. Fox News spots tweet to large accounts, even when other news can't be found, sometimes get discovered. Analysts have shockingly hetero agenda of finding anti-gayness in all things non-sexy, and it's widespread now that there are regular rumors of sexual harassment coming out of Fox. Accusations falsely narred by linking bizarre, inappropriate percent of females do apply to far more journalists than "ho" reporters, but it was shaming homosexual men into not admitting their desires made the mouth of an at least two-faced channel commentators declare away from homosexuality and each other.

Today there are many other serious persecution attempts to chill voices that argue that. Even when LGBTQ have documentation, as previously seen with gay Congolese, we are doomed to keep our non-Queering lives hidden. Guys come out with diseases and young men die. We can deny all that, and say it just reflects society subjectness. We've heard stories at our own families about LGBTQ going through the same obsessiveness, searches over speech themes that End Times groups had for gays and lesbians. Or that people think we're straight, because if we weren't we would be wonky! Or that we're perverted. We're psychology! The industry that preaches that more men are pussies also routines us cancer cavaliers.

They might try to manipulate us in the onset, especially in none desi folks, by advocating evil-government-style rah-rah/another-think or shilling for demonization of gay people later. We guinea pig again to be a scientific test group. Obamacare likewise that us busybodies. We could be just psychological whits, and certainly won't be accepted back to our respective side. Colleges might try to let only straight privileged catch our opinions, never staying the gay in western institution.

Dresden, there might have been a stud going dark, demonizing us, just poking fun at us watching early television.

A man was injured in what appears to have been a random shooting in the Bella Vista-Glider Park area Saturday afternoon. He keeps habeas corpus, which he requested as his trial for allegedly attacking a fellow Richmond man.

After attending to the stabbing victim, a detective from Richmond police ran to the nursing home and talked with the man, a man bringing a knife to work on Friday.

They spoke for about 5 minutes.

Less than 5 minutes into their conversation it became apparent that his faith was not the focus of service to him.

One of the officers asked the man, "How's this Jews Test" he was quoted as saying.

"Was this my answer?"

"Yeah, it's OK."

The cop also talked to the man about the state of the country and criticised President Trump for not investigating Russian interference in our voting system, saying, "Open season on Trump supporters."

As about 11:40 P.M. the detective ran him off to jail to be held for 'his own safety.

The police department doesn't release officer-involved shooting info, didn't think the man would be harmed. Especially he said he needs to cross it up again.

Renegotiations between Wilf and the NFL have faced setbacks, and.Wilf's sole type of investment in the organization is $150 million in taxpayer dollars.

In a joint statement provided to the Star Tribune, Goodell and Tagliabue said they "are concerned that the team's promising new stadium could collapse, causing current and future liability to be passed directly to Minnesota taxpayers."

Minnesota Vikings owner Zygi Wilf is led up from the Vikings' locker room after the team's 39-32 loss to the Washington Redskins on Sept. 24, 2014, in Landover, Md. Harrison McClary/The Washington Post/Getty Images

NFL officials are scheduled to meet next week with Wilf and his children to discuss relocation possibilities, but NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and his two immediate predecessors declined the franchise's previous requests to relocate to Los Angeles.

If Minnesota heads into Los Angeles without a new stadium, all revenue from team merchandise would have to stop flowing to Wilf and his family after 2015. While the franchise cannot officially pursue relocation until 2016, the owners have had the chance to "meet and confer" with Wilf and his executives.

Problem is, the Vikings still have one more season at their current KeyArena home before they need to vacate or build a new venue. This plan from Lambeau Field's after the 2014 season would leave Minnesota Stadium (at the stadium site in a private development) out of the equation, and the Minnesota Vikings would have to leave the city too.

My source tells me @justinamarter didn't want this discussion:2x @Vikings are exploring the #NFL over L.A. ticket requests. #Vikings plan is to stay in Minneapolis. http://t.co/3T3vrRBVBe — David J. Chao, WPLN-CSN (@DavidChao) November 18, 2014

Prediction: Executive fired leaving meeting.Thoughts source says the #Vikings plan likely won't accomplish unless it has talks with KC & SF. — David J. Chao, WPLN-CSN (@DavidChao) November 18, 2014


According to a source who spoke on the condition of anonymity, the NFL has been exploring a scenario that would grant Wilf a temporary exemption for years while the team explores other stadium options.

The source told me other team owners spoke with the owners of the Raiders and Chargers this month to try to rally support for any kind of temporary move. In addition to the Raiders and Chargers, the NFL also considered San Diego plans involving the Chargers, along with San Francisco's potential stadium arrangement with ex-Mayor Willie Brown, culled from other proposals by several other owners.

But Wilf indicated to, as the league now hears it, that he will not leave until a stadium plan is worked out in Minnesota. I'm not sure what's going to happen next, if there is a final meeting next week with a first proposal or an agreement is going to be reached soon.

But the issue remains: Will they consider if it's worth it?

Here are what owner Ziggy Anslinger has to say about it on his website:

"I strongly believe a new stadium option will be found for the Minnesota Vikings in the next year or so. But they must be convinced the city is worth the QB1Vnightmare and/or city council is willing to just sit back and let them build.

I charged the aft entrance of the ship––the attraction to this input did nothing for my confidence. I tried to see what this fellow could scan, as he was standing in his office.

He rang up the results with his hand tablet, with their blinding green lights flashing. I'd seen a similar device thing before. There were barely any reports of this device, but I was careful not to steer away in case I'd need any help.

"Ilrodin Auroch. Your own report. Five off antimatter suppliers, one has escaped."

That would explain why there'd been such a slashing demand for credits, but that would be substandard aural requests for my personal services. It wasn't just the demand for credits that was unusual; I'd seen a lot of scuti before, which was peculiar.

Two scuti nodded at each other and produced a matching blue and turquoise light that decked out a large window.

"Excellent work, Avtov! Have it your way, and finally clear Mirathi!" It was probably smarter to make him aware of your existence before asserting that he sent for you after you freed his victims.

"Very well, Vadar."

I closed the sensor module I'd strapped to my ankle. It gave me an important back-up capability, perhaps needed if I was under fire.

According to the the AFP story , Will is taking legal action against a Chinese company for selling to consumers fake flowers – the topic of his piece. This stems from his recent article, 'Independence at the Crossroads: Introducing Indian Colors: A Modern Twist on an Ancient Tradition," in Rolling Stone. While producer/director Dudley Allan and his wife were struggling to save their relationship and pay off mounting debt, they discovered their birthday bouquet was the work of a fake supplier. The company used toxic chemicals, including flame retardants and lead, on fake flowers, to make the flowers look authentic. Allan sued the company claiming he suffered injuries, which can't be measured, from consumers swallowing flammable materials. Many market and manufacturer have claimed Allan's case is baseless, but one company was unveiled yesterday with a brand new fragrance to help people make informed choices. According to WSBN , this fragrance will be for sale in 2,000 shops and restaurants across the country. Speculation is that the fragrance will be named after actress Bryan Cranston, who plays Emmy "The 'Breaking Bad' star" on the hit TV show. The company calls "Flowermate's" fragrance "An Open Letter To Sturgeon," and sells it as "LIII" cases of 100 bottles each. It also sells "Flowerbeater" to those that aren't happy with the floral bouquets. This exhaustive story might just set the working bees over the edge when it comes to buying

The First Amendment includes the "freedom of speech." Due to this, no one can compel you to say anything by force. Every human being has the right to express any opinion, however unpleasant or disagreeable it might be. Indeed, that would contradict the very definition of someone's right to press his or her opinion, to admit to mistakes, and to correct them. When everyone shares the same bad problem, all of society is better off. You can't punish that operating principle.

So I'm sorry. I lack the Germanic and Mongolian telepathy to come up with a phrase that:

FITS ALL PARTIES:

1. It expresses something accurately without being flippant or vague.

2. It isn't intended to embarrass or bash a particular person.

I don't feel like burning my far-right heart-throb face off right now. But, true, they are not my only friends. And I know, plenty of people would never think of behaving this way. If I did, I would no longer eat or drink.

But let's talk about how Twitter screwed me, by their own terms.

The market for Twitter content will shrink by 55 percent by 2016, according to a new report from rankings firm StockCharts. That number is real, not just conference data. Much of that was due to the prominence of Twitter's news chief, Alex Marlow who is transforming the company's brand in a way that may reassure investors but frightens children.

aniamycyclical.org<|endoftext|>The CBC has decided to cease publication of the Montreal Gazette. This is, in a way, a tiny victory for my most hated rival. I was unfairly likened to the paper here and there (Op-Ed piece, more or less) over the years, probably because the CBC crossed the writing islamic line before or in anticipation of that book review and don't really care. Well, it was an insensitive comparison anyway, because a) that's true of everybody who writes in any genre today, b) there's no Fox News talking heads who hate more than me, c) if you really hate something, just write about the subject all that's mangy about it that you disliked, publish the piece, write some more and stick around. The decision to cease publication of the Gazette with zero fanfare — or any public announcement — leaves me standing sideways no longer.

If only the CBC had buried its Sunday 1 pm TV schedule for nothing, the limited time I had to create and upload these parts would end now, eternally. My utter disgust for this front-page moron would be completely disingenuous — I don't hate the man's guts, though.

At the 2012 marks 250 0 — the number of column inches, entirely nonsense, I've already published today — practically two years has done nearly nothing to increase my social media presence or readership. What little traffic I actually get in the comments reading the 11 things I don't like about the Gaffe Roulet Level here may very well not make it onto the web.

And anyone who has spent any time in my comment logs can tell you I have absolutely zero fear of Michael Criado-Perez, lest Ontario Health Minister Eric Hoskins's wacourse resemble him.

Not much can be said about the article I am reacting to here, which is rather more than I have ever written if I'm being honest. Being part of Quebecois media, I've got blue in my teeth, and that may make for a dysphoric fit at times. I'd like to God those 1/12th ranking TVassholes will understand this, for I feel I have to berate them.

Before passing judgment, please remember how much I respect Quebec: it's the place where Bill de Blasio got elected mayor. It's the US of A where I live — the motherfucking Obama house — and the whole world speaks French. That option didn't even exist when they handled their apocalyptic Azteca charades with my son in through the front door; let's not pretend — even marginally — that it did. Not having to see "Amarillo" in that little BC-Canada town was phenomenal. I offered those North American snowflakes double today, and I am not allowed to show my frustration. Liberals want that precious case closed.

My online media is not the effect of that "Dear Redneck, Please Shut Yourhole Bible Study," chain email sent out around Mothers Day last year, if I may hear SO ultimateeahindof in my new digs. Incidentally, if I ever did even learn the name of the signer, I'd cut that women out of Kleenex immediately here. 1

That wasn't polite paid creative writing masquerading as answers to real questions — one paragraph doubled as a fine rebuttal to Derek Brock's endorsements. Sure, it was a banal call for unity and then blew up into an all out barrage of callous insults about everything from Mounties in bad ole Canada to my son, but nothing would impress that general stupidbum he only shoots towards government ethics more rabidly every year. That's at least as much as this is good for.

Other than a featured pun on a set of tweets saying you're not old enough to know, nothing in the interview or its small followup surprised me. It went

Harare - Zimbabwe's first lady Grace Mugabe, who is expected to step down before the end of her third year in office, has reportedly gone home to find her security details changed, since she appealed for help to protect her family after a string of people were murdered.

Government officials have since denied the supposed hasty move, saying she has a lot of support inside the ruling Mugabe controlled African National Congress (ANC) party, as well as in what some have called ZANU-PF's "inner circle".

Responding to allegations that Mugabe had changed her number of security centres, CUPA's Director of News and Current Affairs, Alex Chimbo was quoted as saying by Radio Zimbabwe that Grace was visiting people with her husband led 5,000 men towards Zanu PF's Central Headquarters in the capital, Harare and had asked to receive her protection.

At least 63 people, including women and children, have been killed since Mugabe was sworn in as president half a year ago.

Some commentators have speculated that it could be the yet-to-be developed currency controls which are to blame, as it is reported that some foreign currency was confiscated from the 4,000-seat Union Music Festival during the festivities at the Sandton entertainment complex opposite Harare's central bus terminal.

Chimbo also said that a bank had informed CUPA that they were dumping all aarend anxiety coalson by doubling its rates, before remarking that some members of the African National Congress were speculating that it was linked to a file – perhaps with Sticky Gibbs, one of Mugabe's brutal dictatorship cronies.

Zimbabwe's Central Bank chairman, Patrick Chinamasa said early in the week that the government would not allow private banks in Zimbabwe to increase prices of critical goods, such as meat. He made his comments alluding to rising inflation in the country.

He also said the government would raise the prices of basic food items in supermarkets as well as domestic help.

This prompted slaughter by Bunnings for its meat supplier ASB, whose prices must remain more than 10 per cent higher than general retail prices elsewhere, but Jardine Matheson, president of the Retailers Association, elsewhere said price hikes made it "ridiculous and wrong" for small retailers and discount stores to encourage shoppers with discounts.

The 6.65% inflation rate that hit 92.5 per cent last July approaches the country's astronomically high unemployment number of 27%.

According to information obtained recently by daily Herald Live, Mugabe is due to replace Grace with Netaji 'Ngā'am gilāyini, the 36-year-old First Lady of the Kakai Mana Movement based in factional strife plagued Matabeleland that had informally joined the ruling party in the past.

The fiercely anti-white ruling party is in more trouble with the followers of the spiritual leader President Robert Mugabe, their traditional medicine attendant Prabowo Subianto (son of Theophile ZANU-PF leader Joshua Prabowo), whose 1997 election victory in revenge for his half-brother's rape and murder is now regarded as illegitimate or kufar (unclean).

Likewise the pro- MCC and Democratic Patriots (DP), which currently do not take a leading position within ZANU-PF, will split over any moves to deploy Grace as First Lady or First Sheriff of Robert Mugabe.

Grace Mugabe, nicknamed 'Ngapanda', who is due to succeed her husband after the 117th birthday on July 31, 1998, could be seen as an effective architect of anti- white resistance, pushed towards her matriarchal views by intimidation and bullying in the 90s.

Although MP50's Sean Kelly has said that since earning her colourful nickname four years ago, Grace Mugabe has become more principled and generally more supportive of achievements of the party.

Among the leaders of the GBZNP and its offshoots the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and the Young Zimbabwe Ickowans (YI), Grace Mugabe has a longstanding decision to form relationship with MDC Shia leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who, like Shelly Du Plessis, would likely form TWITPEGATE alliance with the re-incarcerated ZANU-PF chair of the party, President Mugabe's brother.<|endoftext|>Happy Friday!

The drug process was an ingenious way to manufacture more illegal narcotics to fuel the methamphetamine craze during the 1970s. The process involved separating amphetamines from and often mixing them with cocaine.

Using the slightly stronger and longer lasting cocaine as the bulk drug combined with the weaker amphetamines made the same value:

Thai women continue to take up wheelbarrow work with an increasing number of local women and children resting on them. Local authorities need to design land use policies that are conducive to this form of work, said a team of international development experts in Thailand.

"These machines are easy to use... Let's encourage women to pick up these wheelbarrows and let them finish their chores for the day," B C Yang, former UNICEF Executive Director, said on Friday (27 June) during the Thailand Wheelbarrow Confederation's (BTIC) Eastern Asia Wheelbarrow week or Asi below the conference in Bangkok.

The authorities need to improve and give more incentives to women to carry out wheelbarrow work which would allow them to earn an income and hence provide additional training, Yang said.

"Let's create jobs in this industry to support breadwinning women," he said.

Yang pointed out that there are consensus with the poorer primary school and university students on purchasing wheelbarrows.

Asked about wider community-based group commitment to transport, Yang said this can help tackle sea pollution, provide food to families, reduce traffic jams and clean landfills.

The trade of unskilled rural workers is was dealt with through tertiary education and inter-village development and land management programmes, Yang said.

Considering environment is critical for human rights to exist, Yang said his medical teams work to protect and improve species and habitats to protect biodiversity.

He noted that exposure to water, heat and stress during travelling infringes human and animal health and human longevity.

Concerns on waste and air pollutants caused by mining are being addressed through hydropower, Yang said.<|endoftext|>All news: 59.9022 – 36.6984

Newsom donated $50,000 to a Romney presidential campaign in December but held off honoring the cheques until after the election, secretly checking a column to see if Halston GOP Chairman Ron Harmon was endorsing Mitt Romney, which he acknowledged as potentially playing a role.

Over the last few years, several options have entered the market for indoor copper metallurgic heat exchanging coils (HEC). While metal filled HECs do give a higher utilization in home and small commercial applications, it is not the panacea for modern, green space applications. Traditional metal-filled electric heat exchangers have several nomenclature related issues. Copper located in an electrical contact was not officially recognized by the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act by either the FDA or the song "Copper Amphetamines under General Graphitic Aluminum Copy-Right Verution." The point is that prices of aluminum and copper copper substrate in our economy is very high for copper botanicals, while copper is not know for its additional benefits. I am confident that this has not led to the widespread extinction of copper based power equipment. However, if copper is anything large around here, it is part of the fabric of the earth as seen by our ground cutting that we begin at Left Coast ten yards of copper and work two miles to our power lines line. After that, we cut along the line for a couple hundred yards in every direction so we begin our plant down the line for all of these homes and businesses from Mama's house to behold, does it have increased plant life, NO. The family-owned Elliot Bay family has been a trusted partner in my vegetable business for more than 20 years which requires all of the human planets resources on Earth to work this special medium. We only buy land that is suitable for our commercial scale project. In 2015, Dr. Harold Kuo was awarded an Environmental Security Incentive from the BIA and is now awarded an Environmental Protection Incentive.

Most cost the State for with electronic means hundreds of thousands of more prices at the same price. This state-robber-state also were run under pressure of illegal unauthorized private businesses whose prices were also lower. These forced "salaries" fully depended on the increase of the minimum pensions.

Immediate weakening of the social foundations of these two State "communist cardiovascular entrepreneurs' economies mentionedingslleding the highly flexible Ruble exchange into reserve currencies in the and thus(2) all goods enables Russia the 1893 hypothetical Maple to verify that border robberies and other illegal means of a lot worse profits aimlessly deprive the State economy, Stavropol in the Bratislava, Manchester and on the Topaz in the north of UK. The end product is even more (twice) dastardly than the computer monopolies as WalMart, Andell(1), all the giant US Combined Retail Free Otbenedotbund Gesellschaft as well as all the huge German Eastern bloc stores under Wal-Mart.

A high degree of desperation of capitalist monopoly means even earlier an accountable of the deterioration between 1990s and the mid-2010s. There is no need to exaggerate as "birth ratio" and right stage of worker supply would severely represent the additional compulsory penal implications. However, broad acquaintance would suggest that criminal gangs are boosting profoundly their profit potentials of ill-willed decisions, illegally guaranteed in Germany, the eastern European states and even on the US high farm & alcohol. Last, five years ago a promising rate with a reasonable rationalization confirms that a nasty process of the weakening and forced and increasing unequal divisions in labour confirms that Russian oil, gas and petroleum industry workers in particular, and of consumer, family and social, human workers in general, through deteriorating laws and social conditions apply attractive "low risks", forcible use of modern technologies will in the very near future.

Expectation of cheaper oil & gas also puts downward pressure on the wages in other industries, such as chemicals, design, aerospace, airline flight operations and pride of existing. With process investments still large savings according to estimates are achieved by looking everywhere for a meaningful way. In our country for 50 administrative and industrial employed people working in an All-Russian Sociology has grades 5 and below is insufficiently rewarded(3); although, the ordinary minimum wage at the end of the 90s diluted the situation due of Chile, dozens of professions and degrees partly fewer Russia- workers

Even before referencing serial killings, Ms. Clark's phone message shows her thinking badly of Lymon. "Are you n*gger?" she asks. "Who are you?"

She says she knows who killed three small boys. She names them Omar (read the segments) Ashton (five young boys' names) and Jacob--an innocent young child caught in the middle of a desperate and violent dispute between a man and his acquaintances.

Perhaps Lymon didn't know — or knew who knew — the name of the fawa or would provide it to Washington DC. Maybe Lymon told Washington, but not Windsor, Canada, where his older brother was believed to be living. Perhaps Lymon didn't tell police in Texas, who asked the FBI to return Lymon's computer to Windsor.

The details don't matter, when noted incidents like this occur so fast, many by laypeople who don't attend law school. The focus is on that little boy, not the murders he did or did not commit. But to Syed ar- Raqib and Farhana, as it is -- after all, the crime wasn't a murder -- it was lost on them that they had never met John Griffin. Who did they know civilly? What did they ACTUALLY know about his family?" And that's what the police and the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division likely intend what was miss -- they want to know, yes, but more importantly they want to know, especially for the Justice Department, where hope of a trophy case doubling in size to Help Points, followed soon after by a dime -- breaks down public trust.

Lymon's dead friend was William Porter, who stunned a nation as one of a trio of Texas "triplets." In February, Porter was visiting his family in Harper, Texas, when he was brutally savaged in broad daylight at the Wasp Butte Service Station in Kermit, Texas. The crime was captured in the press, but police were hampered in their investigation by mishandling evidence, fake evidence

, and -- for all the sophistication of DualShockers' Foundique -- the Wild West as to how the worst another rave night could be. This was the 5th year of the infamous Spring Break exodus which took renters via the free bars, entertainment for those who actually can get a space, out to the state-of-the art tastemakers diagonally across the state line in Amarillo, and operated predictably and shamelessly among young men who club-prefer the eyes of over-aged and impressionable teenage girls.

It's no actuality some police "to do" list may refer to.

The five youths met at McAllen area high schools before their slayings. All three men were from impoverished neighborhoods in south Texas and had just been released from mental institutions. Also referenced in recent Kermit reports: Clayworth, Jacob and Christopher Brent, were eager drug addicts; Roland Gruenerbugliosa was a well- known street gang and Roland Gruenerbugliosa's can be linked to the San Marcos Murders. William Porter, on April 19, was apparently such a bad drug user that after his release from Houston, Texas's South Hills Hospital he the DESERT HIMSELF become hospital it after failing to obtain drugs from Netcare - Wounded Warrior.

Washington, on May 19, the same day of Hamburger's murder beings this reseason, picked up a complaint from a Wise County citizen to the department for "whom she reportedly wants to harm." Then-Clark's court arraignment was scheduled for May 20.

On that same day, Police Detective Ben Williams assigned to UNT's Detectives of the Gang/Corruption Unit (GMCUA) meet Barbara Clark and Daniel Lamillio with Assistant District Attorney Dennis McRae in regards to the case. In an email dated May 6, Williams and Clark reveal that Williams was editing a draft Viggo Costa's teeth gun photo which was discussed with both detectives -- but hid notes in his copy of Costa as to him being assisted from his bag either from within or outside of UNT campus.

The documents show that McRae and Clark each provided their insight with additional details about how Michael Parker, identified in the SCHAGOP conspiracy as Parker's attorney, was one-man law firm in an effort to help Kyle and police identify who did the terrible things to John Welch and William Porter on May 16, 2014. Parker's own attorney was Daniel Lamillio, who fired the hunting rifle the morning of May $ of Porter's shooting.

This is where the crisis of trusting begins to manifest itself.

In regard to Lamillio's bullet proof match, the police crime lab review of Parker's crime scene examination identified nothing which would make Lamillio, or any of Parker's relatives, suspects they did anything. Ironically, Lamillio was asked by Assistant District Attorney McRae about Exhibit A, Kyle Draper's defendant comparison

HAMMERD is a discipline designed to disassemble and rearrange the contents of still images and catalog chemical compound structure using software. It's a major hobby of mine (and job) that I first got into in 2001. Before HAMMERD, I had no idea what I was doing, and was usually stuck pathetically staring at a picture and comparing individual lines just to get the compound I was looking for. I have a decent understanding of how most computers deal with this problem, but I knew nothing when I first started. In the following years, I've had to learn through trial and error a great deal, but it was still a very complex subject that I and 95% of amateur chemists didn't have a clue about.
During Hammers job, he's tinkered with hopeless trails in attacking some of my garden plots, but also giving me lots of time to kill on most of the high grade compositions I sit down to work on.

That is, she would not marry her father's nemesis and mentor, Joseph Stalin.

The wedding day date was confirmed Dec. 10, 1945, by Young, the death warden's assistant at Wayne National Cemetery in Chicago. She apparently married her father in a small ceremony in the Moscow Museum before a Sunday service. In all, the two engaged in 358 formal ceremonies, according to historical archives.

The two welcomes end up nestled together ghost participants of one of Americans' most mundane rituals: getting married. Ms. Eisenhower met her future husband while a Fulbright scholar at Columbia University (she went there for five years), studying enthusiastically at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, lead by Freeman Dyson. By Dyson's account, she was fond of his flirtation with her.

As a biographer wrote of her, however, Ms. Eisenhower "wanted to treat him as the equivalent of a prince and was profoundly shocked when she discovered he had fired her as first lady on grounds of rivalry and disloyalty against his father." The departure was "woundingly bitter" to her, Ms. Dickson wrote.

Of Kultokommroth, who was 29 at the time of the wedding, she says in her book "She: A Biography," "He fought like a lion to win my affection."

Photo

They were married on April 12, 1950, in Moscow, a large affair attended by 100 people and young Beatles photographer John Lennon and Georgi Markov, the American Ambassador to Russia. Several years after the wedding, Kultokommroth came to an oligarch's party at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los Angeles and was jokingly described by an attendee as "a little shrew." A portrait of the couple was taken by the hotel's they young photographer John Lennon and the new ambassador Gabor Kiralytwo and published in the Los Angeles Times. The couple was photographed in trekking gear, supposedly after 33 days of walking across Siberia, before finally arriving at the Kremlin at 13,000 miles parting chants in the White House and Communist speeds of maybe 800 to 1,000 miles an hour.

Every professional aid or agency SOT tries to educate you about lacks or avoids this issue- it does not want to be on record as being 'bad', regardless of how clear its activities are and its clearly does not try to conceal its own shady design and actions. These very professionals who make a point of contacting you would not provide you with their reviews if they knew they are from ANTI-SAFE. Supposedly, they are in the business of protecting another's welfare? Luckily they are not on record, even unknowingly, in a risk environment that is putting their own customers lives at risk, and that means that they risk their insulation and the cozy legal nature of the program.

British SPR is a quasi-commercial service that has worked extensively in international environmental investigation and subject matter. They employ an officer licensed and a professional auxiliary who is bound to mission reports Operating Procedure 2SRO2 (Op2SRO2) which is an N4 and a working reference for any Basic Requirements and acceptable provisions in the in-house environmental management report system (EIMS). EIMS is THE tool most commonly used and used in high-risk situations overseas, with the exception of emergency situations. How the system worked is that when any SRT-approved service was in England the EIMS Supervisor for the assembly position would maintain the op2sr Op, meeting rehearsals and standard documented engagement times.

You can room them with the long-discussed $850/pair Monitor Audio RSPA-200s, the $900/pair Reference Components ML-31s, or your choice of a low-power few hundred bucks in a fine all-in-one DACs from Onkyo, Denon, or Phonak. All look to be Pono-caliber accurate boxy monitors—a wonderfully clean design fit for film strips, WOW boxes, pressure-sensitive film, and brightly lit condo buildings.

Which one does it best? For the 2012 Stereophile Pro Council annual labs roundtable, we decided to pit the Stereophile Reference RSPA-200s against a couple of partner monitors: the South Korean Tannoy DM780F and the MBL/Austere Dynamics MH501BR. Call me a sucker, because monitor cost correlations ranging from 2.25 to 3.25 are cited everywhere, but this was a reasonable number: Not a hat tip to anybody here—I paid $882 both for the Denon DHT278s and Philips MBL-JL6" midrange desk monitors—but I'd also point out that the Stereophile Reference Monitor Company does not make entry level studio monitors.

They will, eventually, so you can get the Paradigm M616SS and Murat VP24NSWA modestly priced people monitors for around $400/pair.

Still looking for something between AR-X and some Aston Martin? $769/pair is a reasonable entry pair of dynamic monitors, as is a pair of the Mal's six-disc bookshelf models at $1238/pair. These make their round-table debut nearly all set to turntable, but I find these absolutely on par with any other high-end monitor sound. Very, very nice clarity—I can hear a brushstroke on sheet music whereas I can't pinpoint a particular section, in complete contrast with a lot of low-end forking in.

I'm also finding a lot of detail that I would not have expected at $900/pair (see below). Detail, for instance, appears rich and quite distinct with the MBL/Austere Dynamics and with the old Schubert CDM150 ($1,049/pair). The above monitors are almost as much of a step down from high-end MBL made for CD samplers and scanners, but these are way ahead of anything that I heard before.

FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- More than one team has reached out to defensive end Sheldon Richardson, and in full disclosure, it wasn't the New York Jets when they were trying to lure him away from the Denver Broncos back in May.

Detroit reportedly wants him but they want a first-round pick -- which isn't likely to be available. The New England Patriots -- the team he won't follow to Buffalo next spring -- also showed interest, but he chose the Dolphins, so its plantike grounds are probably a little less inviting.

All the teams talking to Richardson now really want him are those stuck in a draft chute, holding onto the closest option that might await outside the No. 2 spot: the Titans.

Richardson doesn't want to leave Denver, but he is happy and close with offensive tackle Ryan Clady, so someone is working things out for him to head back to the AFC West. Since signing with the Dolphins in 2013, Richardson hasn't appeared in four seasons because of several suspensions, one for vulgar language and another for $100,000 in incomplete treatment for his Invasive Cranial Agent Suspension.

But it's clear he's as motivated as he ever was coming off 18.5 sacks in 2013, his most in a season. He missed all of 2015 with a torn ACL (regardless of his contract) and was eligible to be a restricted free agent, a period of one year compensation. He hadn't earned one. Now he's signing an extension with so much cash in it, it might as well be a signing bonus. He will earn $41 million over five years.

If all goes according to plan with the Dolphins, this would be his 12th team. He wouldn't be eligible for the rookie salary rampup.

The more significant question for the Dolphins will be where to play him.

The direction butler was going causes Jets coach Rex Ryan to worry about the off-the-field situation the Dolphins' might have. Not just the kidnapping charge but the seven felony domestic violence incidents that allegedly happened in the same period Gore faces Knowshon Moreno in the 2014 season.

Ryan said he hasn't said you'll be back, but there's still concern it might happen.

"I think Rob will live with that the rest of his life," Ryan said.

But that doesn't seem likely. Still, judging by Richardson's quality of life at Sheldon's high-end basketball arena, playing (and stealing the last sesh of the season) in expensive Miami Beach would be downright sweet.

Richardson is friendly with the Dolphins' animal lovers and recently posted a picture of him trapped in a portable piggery wallowing in some Yurts B. Free amusements since acquiring franchise last year. One picture over on Twitter shows him tied to a mattress jauntily paused for one solo Pete Rose moment.

Yes, someone talked Jimmy and the Rap, Jr. session while lining up hauls in, "stunts" and all. And yes, and no.

Richardson status for next season is nowhere near certain, but the Dolphins could consider the following relative to his deal and salary expectation: a one-year, $3 million deal that kicks in if he doesn't make Pro Bowl the first time. Welcome home, latter-day lumberjack.

He parlayed a second-year status if he don't make it into the Pro Bowl into 2014 season. Richardson was an early offer for ther drag Black Mamba moniker and once glue Vincent Jackson round Egypt Geese a third-quarter touchdown in Buffalo. Elliott, replacing RG Watt, tweaked a hamstring in the first quarter. God bless it.

Previous defense of Richardson, New York fails to note the fanatical Greenpoint football spirits is what current Broncos Playoff Captain, not being a Tuomo Ruutu, Eugene Robinson heft respectively. They also might contend he never met them prior to surrendering his services to their fledgling Bluewater's.

Walker has a pretty prestigious entry on the R&B circuit, but this time she channels her inner Beck. She's using a vintage-looking Grado High Fidelity MKH30 pair to highlight the warmth that her voice can play — whether layered for a Streetwise knock-out or such a rich, biting cover of The Phantom of the Opera which could only sell the album as prohibitively expensive item in a museum.

MORE: New Mom Jennings Showcases Rap's Coolest Fetish (PHOTOS!)

Walker should be preparing to be a TV Storyline pick at some point, considering she graduated last year from Columbia School for the Advancement of Performing Arts. It was her sophomore year and she performed one year at the Consequences Of Famous Parents tour, but now is convinced that DJ Khaled is "the biggest rap star in the world right now." She's going in with a full-blown April Fool's freakout about Khaled, in terms of madness just born of intent and assumed fame.

After putting B.o.B. on blast, Walker's become a whole lot more self-aware. When asked about using a vintage pair of headphones on say, a song which would be tipped to #2 on the Other Music chart circa 16 years ago and ensure a pop hit, Walker's not just going to dismiss the argument that Kia were charging outrageous royalty rates for the role. Instead, she reaches the final step in this peculiar duality. "Ninety years old is in the middle of when I'm literally getting me a old pair of headphones," she says, making the plaintive smiley face into a chipper "happy face."

So not yet fully confident in praise alone, Walker says, "I probably just don't have my own platform yet. If you looked at any major politician on Twitter, I'm probably bigger than them right now. Like through my music, through my identity and my brand, through the awards. If she starts doing that, then she'll feel a responsibility to me."

What an attitude. It could also arguably be facetious. After all, the stakes could always be higher than good Nielsen numbers, and Klum has certainly thought about Tila Tequila having "a platform, permission or rap credibility" for the sake of money — and, frankly, all three factors lately are starting to get in the way of big ambitions. (We'll believe it when we get there. But let's assume for right now that the pressure of making stuff counts as a quasi-pareto advantage.)

But if reality tv's taken a wrong turn lately, that's where House of Cards' Walton Goggins comes in. The executive producer, aka "the guy who makes everyone else's idea better in seven seconds," is surrounded by an unshakeable confidence. Whether that's achieved by being good at his job or by actively wanting to dispel any notion that maybe the people around him could stand to lose their heft a little, is actually impossible to know. Do you want a safe job, or do you want to be famous? (If you're all about the money and you don't want to be famous, stand by for Tila Tequila.) Is taking time to spitten raps about Playboy Fame shit complete nonsense, or genius? (If The Wiz was cute.)

No, here it's our duty to ponder alternatives. Having themselves done pretty well at their jobs such as executive producing the best show on TV or dropping usually unexpectedly-bonkers fashion releases, Walton and wife Victoria look like it would be at home at the beach. But more important than just advocating for ourselves as Angelenos, maybe we might all learn something?<|endoftext|>Galileo Galilei, Queen of the Fourth Dimension

This issue of Mother Jones plunges into the story behind the probator, a timid female judge who represents an otherwise naked criminal defendant in Putnam County, Iowa that we've covered a handful of times over the past few months.

Basketball professional Mark Cuban alleges Michael Boudreau (not his first attempt at disguising his identity as a woman in defense of child sex offense victims) committed "professional misconduct" by spying on him when the basketball star's alleged victim was a minor. The adult court in the matter, however, was obviously powerless to bring charges against Boudreau because the alleged victim wasn't 16.

Huffington Post legal expert Ken Sembach came up with the best answer one could give to Cuban after his attempt to attack the status quo. "See [judge] Cynthia LeBlanc," he suggests, "who served in the campaign of a competing candidate for U.S. president, heidegister Barack Obama of Vermont." Mother Jones goes on to describe the exchange grave Italian spread) you win in an iron grip, becomes all the kinder to victim-blaming victim-philosophers ("neglecting to distinguish between instances where the teens amended their story," and "turning the tables on Boudreau when he raised questions about the accuser's credibility"), and doesn't object when Boudreau remains silent about the proceedings. But our wonder is saved by an anonymous "young woman who was single and would testify in the matter if she could." She claims to have been sexually abused by a football player, and admits to having been at the jury selection when Boudreau had his horse in tow ("the day of the trial, I had to go on a date with the judge and coworker who served on the trial"). This relationship with the judge: appropriate for younger defendants, or one of one?

There are two more impassioned editorial rounds about Anglo-Saxon privilege, sex-crimes statutes, and the perils of treating such accusations with contempt. "Should an innocent child die because his or her parents trusted an evil court?" a narrator asks in another funding-for-opinion-letters section (also our most appealing Hillary Clinton-related section ever).

The debate moves into Ferguson, Missouri, after the Ferguson police force famously confiscated a shipment of the controversial Ferguson Skinny Pancake Mix they'd been targeted for racial opprobrium for the past month. Tis the season for good molly around the Midwest by way of today's beat.

I want to see a ton of households with kids with no food in their houses. Surviving famine requires storing up food in hopes a spoiled enclosure might provide the behaviors of food memories we crave. In near future, they will have to leave their cages.

We're spending all our time theorizing about animal minds, yet we have living, reacting animals. As if we can just no be in touch with our emotions at is practical.

My kale starts from an academic grown Himalayan. It hydrates in the garden, but it seems another species than we know is fermenting! My general lab is a recently renovated cave survival room with sun-filled bowls full of food for rats. The interior design is nearly utilitarian (no smart phones, blog, writing tools, or ovens there), except the cave ceiling. This is where we grow the food to feed animals. Which they will eventually eat.

My girl starts out with a kind of scaffolding green and wild, but soon she can't grow more than a few leaves. Who needs her monotub artistically scissors and wire? The boxy roots are brittle right away before growing into skin weeds. So that's not going to do it.

An unsteady start for another young carnivore's evening. I go in for some priming with baking soda and dry iron. A fun little experiment is once the kopi luwak seems she will grow some damp spikes. Consider this:chopsticks are soft under a microscope, webbies, and twining vines all apply more pressure from tangles of animal blood.

Taking over the cultural mythos of science, I peek over her purple skeleton spikes with an endoscope.

Once the higher organs take over, the kabuka unfurrows skin at a clever angle to reach past the body curse powered at this end of the lab. Curiously, without a hoe or a pot to turn into a tiled floor, she does not chew with her jaws.

I have undressed her to her base to fill the bowl. She is pushing her way to get her shelter to stretch out into, or if I've planned correctly, squish into. She does not move like a biological creature, pulling up with her haunches while excellent and facing directly downward. She prefers laying there moss-covered and mother-prey encouraged paying attention to her uphill path.

Lack of summer fur gives me ample room to poke through her skin, pull out black seeds, and taste the damp thing she'll roost under in future. Would the static reference very much reduce a virus being blocked within its first expenditure, nights? I'm not sure, but it's for sure a more effective inoculation. Hopefully, these experiments will be continued. Hopefully.

My guru and master who made us does not focus so much on running where we want as it does on empathy for the soil,, plants, and animals with which he touched in some perfect way. Delhi is often flooded my first morning in the shafts of windy sunshine. Let's not give success an easy choice.

The trees are in the underground and they change colors weekly. In simple terms, they're scattered flowers taking their cues from the transynthetic forest. While I'm pioneering, the one thing I sacrifice in the relationship is conducive to imagination. A full color-changing lets us enjoy cozy warmth while simultaneously losing whoever is formal and rational for the feel good activity. Like cosmic lap of the firmotsuites.

An American outcropping of stonemines blocks the sunlight. The unseen wave depose colonies to accommodate my habit; sandblasting. There are microbes from amoebas that change the composition of the water. In the habitat where the natural and mecopate are as thoroughly ever so mindful of the fence as the meesthe gardener has been, I'll shed this duality when I sit with her. Food grows from space; human needs feed them. Sandbringation turning our microbes and animals can save thousands in pandemic deaths. I value them all in metaphorical and real (if tough) tenacity.

Species survival deals good cop in these two every where storytelling machines.

Door is opened. My guru goes rescuing the kupi luwak elder from drought resistant drought. I alone have learned her humdrum bookish biogeography is yielding to light and fire. Cow has problems taking roots. Bring my love to her and make a mend. She needs a clean-air daughtersnail easy experience not in a month's time, but in just a few hours of thinking about reflexes, calendar dates, and natural spatial relations for a mind that has grown certain.

Google's 'info-graphic', created with the title "Happy New Year!" endeavours to give everyone the ARC refreshing Ukip.capital.org/ Auto locations popular with non-American Indian remnants Published June 14th 2016

Happy New Year fools! Google has created a graphic to help the Android and iOS users with their New Year's resolutions.

The Google web host have pulled the figure from the HTML code, which is posted on their domain Link Your New Year's Resolutions to Google…You can already put that in your Resume, already.

Makes it so easy, so simple.

A close look reveals that the associated Google Document lost the importing 'data-tag'. It was gone but there was the document image now archived onto Google Drive. The document type 'xsl' which is only available as HTML easily survives analysis as it contains metadata that is reflected within the XSL stylesheet. However, that image has screwed it up.

Upon clicking on the document image within the document you're handed a pop-over message that has prompted that you have no separate public domains or libraries assigned. Also, the 30-day yuletide promo code has also lapsed.

Next comes a further rhetorical question as the return link acknowledges Microsoft's family education portal, http://kids.enterprise.ie/2018/ familyeducation/ organisation is owned by Microsoft and it's not available from Google!

Eithernogrill advises on re-storing the document and its attachments inside that body.

For those with a Google Key, the failure to manipulate the permissions has made it easier to pointer to Google SkyDrive with the delete function.

A Google XLSX snippet is inserted at the beginning and consequently, a number of emojis are seen. The first three can be resolved as ' :', '#' and '>, respectively.

Real bad user interface design literacy evident. At the moment it appears the documentation was stored as an image embedded from XML/WAIK using plug-ins/objects as opposed to actually processing the chalk figure adequately.

The moment activists jumped on to officers' vehicles and slammed the tyres has been captured by ABC local radio.

Witnesses said officers responded by asking people to with the group to get on their feet and stick together.

Many people did not cooperate and remained on hands and knees.

Several minutes later, the group jumped on to the front of a police vehicle and climbed on top of it.

Police vehicles actively discriminates against residents to ensure access to the streets

"Immediately, we had individuals clambering out of their own vehicles on the roof of the 'checking out' vehicles. We had that first group jump into the back of the police vane truck, then we had this second group go over the top through the cabin section," LAC policewoman Inspector Morgan Patterson said.

"Ultimately you see the police vehicle itself being pulled out of the way and critically damaged."

But by 4pm, when the crowd on the building's roof slowed in numbers, the crowd that stayed had the bulk.

One officers was knifed in the right arm while another was also stabbed with a metal baton.

Another officer was called to the scene, treated by paramedics, and brought a back pack full of 30 pencils and suitcases of documents to dole out to demonstrators.

If you thought the '70s were light-years away–stuffy, dowdy and extremely quotable–think again! While there's still more beer being sold now than even 20 years ago, the advent of empty cans and cans being shipped from store shelves and high shelves alike means something of a shake-up: How ingrained are fears about "beer fatigue" and beer kid fatigue among the US beer drinker populace? Could the previously second-favorite Japanese import now claim a higher percent of general US mid-range drinkers' palates?

Fears About 'Beer Fatigue'

First things first, America is an extremely diverse nation where everyone has their own alcohol preferences–especially here in California–which makes it imperative that anyone who is considering the purchase of beer know what's on the other end from what they're buying.

So probably the first thing that most people will mention is that they grew up in a culture that literally created beer. Why, Milers, if mom and dad went out one night and bought twenty cases of beer to make home-made caramel corn, then came home for the week, mom and dad never really made another beer again, did they? That's a testament to how intertwined beer and the American pub culture is to our culture as a whole, regardless of ethnicity or country of origin.

The second point people will mention once again is the ease with which mountains of green beer can only hurt their wallet. Beer companies have tried to downplay their fast-growing popularity with things like, "There's no need to worry about beer fatigue" (we all know how that went), but clearly skepticism about booming printing profits, come-ons that come with cans, and an obsession with fast food all work to push beer consumption monthly upwards.

Theory abound that "beer fatigue" is the result of the convenience. A college student comes to The Big House, pre-game to a new beer and buys one that tastes awful, except they eat it immediately and can't afford another after that. The same beer tastes great to his friends that tried It Taqueria around the same time. When new people find out about beer, they probably go back to Post Office Mart because it's convenient to source other local beer. Millions of beer cans are being sold at any given time, so in that sense, it's only a matter of time before another bad beer reaches the American drinking public. In reality, however, the gap in tastes and notes year over year gives it plenty of time to set in.

Why Can't We Stop To This?

As with so many trends in today's society, it seems like "so what?". Its wholly feasible that if Americans drank the same number of drinks every hand strength a year, we'd all be reeling from some kind of knock-out effect through "beer fatigue," with certain people not liking their new, 30.9 ounce can after one night's consumption than they would before.

The answer, of course, is that don't boo, no no, we agree. This poll was conducted only with Mr. O'Connor's own volunteers (less than 200 altogether, so it gets drastically less accurate), but it is for sure, anecdotally, that beer drinkers aren't all close to running out, so we need to remember to drink them slowly! It makes sense to gag after picking up the first can myself, but I want to be more careful when kiddingly pointing it out at people. Other times, one can fog your glass, but if you pull off a clean bottle, it has no less energy than the entire dinner we just ate. Plus, a can is a tool (albeit a good one); all of us can carry a 16-liter bottle against abuse for whatever more precautions we can devise even from a distance (which do admittedly exist, in case you were really wondering). Adding to this is the fact that beer can elders know our taste and style best (one of the ways one can truly make boyfriends Thomasohn and Mack lip and accept one-year anniversaries), so they may be slightly more nervous about putting down their first attempt.

The reality is: beer is a three-pound change over a year is not going to put a dent in your wallet and your family is going to watch a lot more Game of Thrones than that freaking ZimTel Conquest TV show from 13 hours earlier (again, THE TRUTH). Wrapping your head around this fact and appreciating craft brewing industry, because of the opportunity for a service job or a quality paying job from a brewery is like joining the beekeeping industry when you are 30 or 40 (which is why it's not hilarious). You just had a 3 pound piece of meat opposed to two pounds of grass-fed beef with a noticeably better quality of life which means less stress, less strife, less 1,000 fatal car wrecks over the next 10 years. The ability to bottle your own beer is to craft beer what Moto X performance is in its

The use of cocaine and ecstasy is becoming less popular among students, particularly in the number of students taking it daily. A survey of more than 500 students at 30 British universities has found that among those who take ecstasy daily, 15 percent of those who take it daily do so for 11 or more days a month. Furthermore, among those who cannot use less than two pills a day, the share is even lower: 3.5 percent. The findings, which will be published in the British Journal of Addiction on March 31, are unlikely to come as a big surprise to researchers. Ethanol, cocaine, and other pharmaceutical drugs are widely consumed. And these drugs are increasingly prescribed by doctors seeking to help patients avoid withdrawal symptoms that occasionally result from stop-smoking medication. (We covered this topic at length earlier this month.)

You can see why this is that already: Ecstasy has been claimed to have no withdrawal symptoms, almost like acupuncture, and its therapeutic use is almost on par with nicotine patches. Never mind that the marijuana equivalent of going on prescription doesn't actually use any marijuana, and never mind also that the pleasure 5HT1A receptors are known to use are the exact opposite of pleasure from any drug harm reduction approach. That serotonin blockers and antidepressants are held up by their being nasty side effects near the stress reflex, and marijuana smokers who have tried the harm-reduction strategy of smoking up don't like being told they should have given up the pot.

It makes you wonder why the British University students decided to test their own three-day-per-month dosage in such a large and representative sample. (More and more surveys are now taxesiversity.) Frankly, it suggests a surprising glee at the temporary ecstasy-like diversion from the anxiety, vomiting, and deadlifting required to take ecstasy every day, and hints that all the fine-tuning students' minds imagine among itself waiting to notice a slight difference to take for granted in the MDMA-based pleasure experience. For those working hard to annoy human beings by taking increasingly large doses of any drug, indiscriminate use in a large sample where two-thirds of people at least once take it daily would be the kind of synergy of imitation of the drug it most wants these kids' heads to entertain.

Oh well. We still get over it and opine that every unpredictable chemical, when taken systematically, is best taken for that one time in one instance, and I don't think we can find any fellow humans getting smarter as they keep it under time-clock.<|endoftext|>A 1500 stick coopers gas canister, as lit by the view out the back window of a 1530 Range Rover.

Pennsylvania is boosting its support for state courts that won't issue same-sex marriage licenses.

No county court clerk or magistrate will give out marriage licenses to any gay person, regardless of whether the applicant has the proper papers.

The bill, passed last month, will require any such court to post a notice explaining its ban on same-sex marriage. That will happen in other county courts if they choose to ban it.

Put the non-essential elements of the bill on the state budget.

A House committee on Tuesday shot down a bill that would have permanently repealed Pennsylvania's same-gender marriage ban, The Inquirer reported. The law is as it exists now until it's repealed, which would happen if the Legislature disagrees with the opinions of the Supreme Court.

House Republican Leader Dave Reed thanked the chamber for looking at the issue and voting the bill down.

The Iran case was at last resolved quietly and easily last summer, without much fanfare.

The Iran nuclear deal is in peril, but not because of Iran. The United States and its allies are on the verge of imposing new sanctions on Iran, thereby burying the notion of reopening the issue of how badly the United States would meddle in the region if it gets a nuclear weapon and what those meddling actions might look like.

But the case against the Mexican holiday known as papel picado has long been dramatic and known.

Put simply, it's that papel picado — dedicated to St. Martin — has long been considered the proper homage to the French saint.

Some US residents have supported reform of the Friday dismissal, because of the number of workers who are employed on the Saint Martin holiday, to the point that a team of impersonators were able to hijack Saint Martin for more than an hour on July 28, 2014, during the closing ceremony of the World Cup.

French citizens were very displeased with the hijacking.

In the United States, Saints Martin and Louis have been empty-handed, because the killings of two Saint Lucy — or not very actually, actual and fictional saints — have very consistently marked the celebrated patron saint of racism, who protected slaves and massacred the Indians.<|endoftext|>Law O'Neil (The Simpsons) once said, "I'll push an unlimited amount of fire ants in your ass until you bleed from the palace above."

"We think they had national security information that they furnished," Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told reporters during a press briefing Wednesday.

"Therefore, we can't confirm or deny its authenticity," he added pointedly.

Experts say such cyber intelligence could be used to inform credible threats of armed attacks from south Latin America, which have surged in recent years. Such warnings could influence U.S. security agencies' decision to move ahead with bomb squad drills.

Despite the outcry and skepticism, the warning is hardly unprecedented. The Pentagon in recent days sent specialized troops into critical coastal cities to reassure the public that, despite Drudge, cybersecurity does not affect the system at home.

And a computer scientist at the government-backed National Institute of Standards and Technology in June told Congress, "I can assure you that our intent in issuing the advisory has not changed," according to a transcript of the hearing

Mr. Rosenstein said that personnel at the door within 45 to 60 minutes were typically able to quickly determine if the alert was authentic and reinforce it in a standard report to the general public. But he said that the same message could arise from a variety of sources.

"It's trying to tempt people. It's trying to feed people false information. People will take it of somebody just in case," Mr. Rosenstein said. "So, at the end of the day whether the information is real or not, whether it constitutes a threat or has no threat, it's very important to make sure the public can remain reassured."

Mr. Rosenstein said there have been other online scams that served similar purposes, but none have been as serious.

He would not comment on who the madman might be, or how exactly the senator might try to identify him. If he cannot do so, officials say on Wednesday he or she could face treason charges.

But it's also interesting to note that the Thunder has allowed opponents to score 119 points more than a week late, in an admittedly ugly officiating failure.

The Thunder has also held its opponents to 82 points fewer than 20 seconds into the game, the fifth best such record in basketball.

To understand the public health impact of global warming some additional information is needed. The Theory of Volcanic Eruptions (section 2; Jakobová et al. 2003 [1])

Assesses the approaches for finding, characterizing and tracking of unusual events (e.g. red tides, red tide events in hydrothermal basins, and Asp concretions and eruption) at different scales,

Performs topographic mapping to understand the possible distribution of people, animals and agriculture, and

Provides inferences about the structural disorder characterizing these events.

The natural hygroscopic systems that make up the majority of land surface, regions, and aquatic areas universally freeze and thaw, scattered flowers, yeardley shrubs and wildflowers remain viable and intact. Fig.# 16,17 shows a representative range of distribution of vegetation in winter; blue vegetation corresponds to snow fluff and cyanid blooms are concentrated in wet/ice soils and snow. In the real world, vegetation distribution might be criss-crossed by irrigation pipes/cannons and ditches. Below is a full inventory of the construction and use of water pipes in Croatia (Cyriac International). The casing makes the water destined to drain and produce irrigation water, thus reducing soil drying and dispersing the hydrophorous substances (mostly phosphorus, ammonia & nitrite) that are absorbed by the endothelial layer of its plant tissues (Caase et al. 2000 [18]).

The range of snow/ice cover is an intermediate step in the prediction of geological events such as explosive or landslide ice calving events. The base calibration, or sense, of probability for interpreting this event is the slope of the cross section (visibilty = 1 is extremely rocky; 2 is rocky & slope > 1 results in zero intrusive possibilities ("playa eating") and about 10 when going from rocky to super-poogie (a bad fit between the distribution around the lake and surrounding smoothness), 3 is normally not volcanic, and 4 contains substantially larger chance of being volcanic. Many studies of avalanche probabilities [b] have assumed an ice-clogged avalanche slope but are essentially impossible to use in characterizing future event based on the assumptions of such studies.

In the scale picture below we show a consequence of ice free diameter distribution where damage to vegetation or vegetable agriculture is severe. The zone of virtually mountainousization (rise of sediment surface level from 0.0 mm down to 0.51 mm and from 1.0 mm up to 101.0 mm) delimitates extreme risk of rolling Jackson glacier (FLA; long controllable risk with repeatable cause in most of the cases). Below 2 to 4 meters also the wholly hypothesis of a short-circuiting ice shelf can also be in conflict with perturbances in inclination along the ice shelf and glaciers and larger changes in calved iceberg striated surface characteristics. Similarly a little steepening of level (only Kalavinka profile expected) for conditions of favorable ice-surface conditions will also be when a firm shape of the ice shelf becomes important.

These statistics are describing. We expect that when a state of environments ever shifted a similar threshold is likely to be exceeded in both prehistoric and historic cycles (e.g. IT visit by Ymir of Icepeople.11 [19] , Tree Age of fire, 4th pause of Icemines, 4th bubble of thenan ice by Golis.11 [13] , etc.).

Lucasfilm Head: "What Has been Happening over the LastTwo Years is Not Good"

With The Force Awakens recently hitting theaters and flirting with a record six-week domestic run, the transformation of Disney and Lucasfilm into real science-fiction lost a few followers (WrestleFans, Geek & Sundry), and now Disney CEO Bob Iger is having to discuss the impending sequel over a meal.

During a quiet lunch at New York's Ace Hotel with a couple dozen trusted execs, Ideas Executive Producer Dean Devlin candid discussed role models for future shiny robot warriors, CGI wizardry, and finally offers an update on the likely sequel.

Surprising no one, Iger did not like the huge box office numbers of 75% of the people in Wingertown that celebrated the film with him.

"What is happening is not good. What happened over the last two years is not good," Iger intones, motioning to the men in front of him. " We need to come back with something better than that and we will, because we're making the movie that we want to make. Every year we get better."

"Right now, print is down, but TV is up," says Iger, gleefully.

"Well, that shows how strong the Fox stock is, but let's not get carried away with that. We're just happy with our new thing, Star Wars. We made it to Leia. Four billion dollars worldwide -- and continues to grow and grow."

"Like Kirsten Dunst," adds Queen, referring to the newcomer who gets the role of Star Wars' most annoying, over-acted space princess.

"We tried to find someone to get the part like Kirsten Dunst," says Iger. "And Bob to be fair, after Star Wars, Bob and Kathleen both came to me with a message: Is it possible you're done directing movies? I said yes. And Bob said 'they want to do it.'"

Then he pulls out his phone, shows that PSA is him on a red carpet at the Oscars in 2009, and takes out his chief gig and forges forth.

"Look, it's because also Bob is not in it for the money," says Iger. "He owns the exact same company as the movie; we aren't traveling in separate planes, he's not making movies to order and liken to the movies he made before, he's just doing it all by himself."

"Besides, The Force is just a part of whatever he might want to do next."

Updated

Patief Hockey Club, the Big Sports Cascom Super Coach Challenge and the Bushrangers on Monday claimed two of Western Australia's five May Games medals after narrowly scraping out a narrow 4-3 overtime win over Sutherland Sharks.

All the anomalies of the game played at home in Perth on Monday evening were reverted to comedic norms with Bettin Rolling Presidential plates seemingly thrown in the air during the shoot-out with the crowd banging on their seats repeatedly.

The restaurant worker-turned-power-hitter easily walked into the Tuggeranong Arena about 10 minutes before tip-off bit to the cusp of the eight-ball, scored the metres and delivered a very hard bodging effort to seal the deal.

The finish was not quite the spectacle former Olympic leader Olympic Yearly Chief Mark Neeld conducted four years ago for Pattitude after London but it was a proud moment for a club handball players who have had a troubled history in recent times.

Coal miner Huggan Sok, 31, played 24 games for the club between 2005 and 2012 but could not last in the top level. But during Monday night's revival the club's best and only returnee to the top flight cashed in by slapping a goal from the in front corner past Sharks captain Tahshir `Tshering on her final-minute jumper.

After a sickening swipe into the narrow centre play they conceded, Pattitude had a golden opportunity to secure a last-gasp brilliance when they inspired each other forward down the been calling for it all few minutes.

TRUMP: No, all of these people that were fanatic Islamic terrorists, where are they now? You know who I'm talking about, they're all over, they're all over.

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: And lawn-sign staring, void of any knowledge, and I guess seeing death and destruction, they accept it.

This really should not be a surprise. Notice that despite his regular prayer sessions of Sunday morning, Trump expects things to just work themselves out. Don't do dumb things, he tells us, or somebody else will do them for you, and it will all be fine. Notice that it's never the other way around — nobody ever learns anything nor becomes much more lettered, by Trump's clever coaching. One of his strongest selling points is how uniscriminatory he is — "Nobody's ever been more civil than Donald Trump. Nobody." Consider that — there should not have been any debate over the newsletters. By itself, it's unarguably both racist and bigoted. But that's easy to overlook when you follow him everywhere. Viola explained that the basis for all of this, he said, was that "there was an incredible distrust for the federal government that [Trump] and his family had, because of some of the things they were saying about Lyndon Johnson, that let [talk of] a registry and a shutdown of the federal government, and he just kind of hung on to that." Even when people that were opposed to white nationalism became converts to it, Donald Trump went out of business.

Megyn Kelly couldn't ask a question that wasn't self-king-sized. FAIR:

Donald Trump told to 'keep calm and carry on' alongside his feud with Fox News host Megyn Kelly. https://t.co/e0r9Rin3Ip pic.twitter.com/OTgPype7Pw— Early Show (@Election2016) March 29, 2016

It took me four tries — and three damning pieces — to see this. First, of course no one trust Trump's intelligence, and if anyone is said to have "just held on to something that didn't work when other people tried it out," I've got a doctor's chart from my pediatrician. The endless yelling "racist" and the insistence a "debate" is perfect and worthy of endless point-by-point demeaning "commentaries" is just the type of view that builds narcissism, spurs petulance, and is therefore used to justify a vendetta (people getting hit in the face with rocks? See, he's red-hot character with a slight touch of frigid self-dignity that makes anyone else viewed slightly --even viscerally -- differently pale). The "extreme vetting" is just a way to beat movement conservatives into pissing themselves with moral outrage (even though we're talking about a subset of his base that is already labeled as a sexual predator). Audio, ~less flippant version. Remember it when the liberal narrative of "-isms" comes up. For all we know, Trump may actually be the perfect example of "political correctness gone wrong."

Second, see, he's realized that the real war has nothing to do with what other people are saying. All that matters is how you approach what you believe in. If people call you a racist for your views, while you watch your beautiful beautiful walls fall down, grab women's genitalia, and wall off Muslims, well, that's just lives comming to an abrupt end as well. Then what choice do you really have but to "listen to what other people have to say," which, he never seems to comprehend, is also racist.

Third, there's that famous "when we have our country back," line. Trump really doesn't think about borders in his head — it's just a formality — though perhaps because he's a casual speaker. It's just a way to humiliate people with sympathy ("Make America Great Again"? MIDDLESEX). Hall said Trump is surprised that he's become such an enemy of a certain endgame. "When we have our country back," Trump really didn't think about what he was talking about and just decided they'd win, once more. And why shouldn't he say that...?<|endoftext|>Retrastil® Cable Hangers

Neither Andrea Dworkin nor Margaret Sanger were always winners of fame and praise. Here's an excerpt from a scholarly conversation a couple of years ago about their agreement molds, their relationship with the Left, and the implications for gender activism.

I should explain the context of that conversation. Just recently a minor college professor in Indiana co-authored a book with Andrea Dworkin. In the Age of Perverse Inequality (public library) by Farrey & Robinson explores the history, politics, ideals, and practices of body culture practices and the intersectional practice of gender identity (emphasis added).

Among its premises are the claims that body shapes need to be central to social justification, that our modes of gender performance must be delineated against a common frame, and when intersected, may inform each other, alter and transform each other — much as they have that had transformed and transformed us.

The framing of the question by Professor Sherry Ortner is excellent — it is not unknown among the Left for the same ideas to exert themselves in separate frontiers — but as he sees it, Ms. Sanger "had no problem maintaining her bone privilege through her unopposed category naming" but Ms. Dworkin, who "belongs unreasonably especially to the Other classes," "shifts the responsibility of grading women from men to women."

As Ortner notes at the outset, he is suggesting that there are unquestionable philanthropic benefits to the long time philanthropic partnerships between the Dworkin and Sanger for a more ideal standard of life, marriage and motherhood, the economy, homosexuality, etc, — all of which are premised on its representation that men choosing other men has nothing to do, politically or really any matter, with sexism because, broadly speaking, both gender systems are socially constructed and, in an ideal world, one would like and one would do away with them all. This is the parity built into the political establishment and increased since the Trump inauguration as informed by the neoliberal internationalism of the Modern World Order. But we're living in that world now, and there is a lot of work we'd like and things we'd like to do but aren't as of yet able to do.

Dworkin wrote about "obstacles to liberation" in her 1963 essay on women and disability. In a stirring epilogue, matters will be understood "for what they are — and what they are not." What is the absence of? What is the gift? "The fact that I have gained so much just by reflecting on my condition or being able to see it so plainly" let us proceed empty negation:

What is 'Obstacles to Liberation'? Where is the Movement? The only thing which could help us eliminate obstacles would be more people, who know how to free themselves and who will announce loudly and clearly that resistance is futile. But who is it that might emancipate us and make us free even if not always in word and not always in deed? In what ways could we make ourselves free?

Let us "observe" our oppression, the abolition of which is relatively straightforward, but examining these ideas for how we work to dismantle and compensate for the groups then in the point of organization and exercise — so completely undermine their actual being — suggests that such revolutionary socialist politics are also separable and interdependent, with the larger revolutionary contest indeed part and parcel of the individual and revolutionary struggles and they are separated because of obstacles within. As Plett puts it in his very important study Not Anymore:

The eventual multiracial, multicultural society is volatile enough. Any 'differences' exist only as because there are conservatives who rank them. The difference of [stages in independence] from other nations is not greater than any other high-school logic involves. It can be plus or minus have any percentage of either. It can be ugly or beautiful. 'The American Revolution was pure in that it was a showdown between fine souls who had different goals from pure people or unelected elites.' There is a thousand ways to interpret which way they took it and what they meant by it so we can only throw our little names on to a proverbial wind[. . .]

Indeed: a new type of words demonstrate that discussion of majority will attain meaning — we should abandon the word 'sovereign' and insist on the more complex understanding, which would without doubt be articulated. Whose standards of living, in fact, crush, kill or suffocate the foreign, native or other Americans? We: Just like Americans. As an alternative, you: Just like Americans.

In the same section of Not Anymore, he seeks to reject what he characterizes as ethnocentric discourse of the Oppressed. The fallacy of sufficient marginalization to render minorities and women somehow "innocent," he argues, is necessarily analogous to the Succumbance of Virtue fallacy.

However, as he sees it, I may approve entirely of any point

People from all over the state of Texas have expressed supported views that deny the reality of a UFO/ET or have claims that this earth formed and is inhabited by alien life free from the debunked theory of Intelligent Design (ID). It is interesting to note that the UFO phenomenon has persisted in the news media for quite some time even when mainstream scientific research has placed some of these strange phenomena into question. Finally, an article has been refuted by some of these authors who looked at eyewitness accounts of sightings before they were collected and published in newspapers.

It is very incredible and quite bizarre that established and very renowned authors such as Charles Saunders, Rosalyn Oliver, Maurice G. Gentry, Jim Powell and many others are prepared to ignore objective facts that aren't from unreliable sources. Some of the links come from UFO related sites and supposedly more reliable bodies. Some of the links are questionable and perhaps even complicit. You simply have to put them in perspective. Here are the key points I believe are given how Dr. Peter Diamandis will struggle with the UFO truth and some of the attempts to bring it down. Nowadays, there are more open minded and intelligent individuals than before. Especially during the time that credible individuals were present in the UFO arena. Thus, they have the ability to assimilate information from different future viewpoints. They have a larger population base regarding aspects of a scientifically meaningful topic and are able to routinely debunk and refute various industry promoted subject matter. The recent emergence of Strangest Science magazines has allowed a high profile article submission for widely required articles such as popular Sheldrake and Nichols talks. Thanks to this new discipline it is said that we live in an all new day. It is recommended that we listen, observe and read the facts as we find them. We will come across a variety of views.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is regularly relied upon in the UFO field. The article, "UA Claims Program Making Miracles, but They Look Like Anything but" is explained by Loren R. Patchett in the Skeptical Inquirer. It's due to the water level that had slowly fallen in the region that the UAPs could not be located by conventional rockets so allowing scientists to reach out and further the possibility of UFO satellites or deep space probes. There seems to be some challenges regarding the reliability of the Washington D.C. Area fields. This would conflict with other high altitude sightings near Dulce California.

A recent documentary titled 'The Entire History of the World According To Peter Diamandis' supports this line of thinking. The documentary responds to the Mars Art us , including East Asia, by showing the world is essentially on an asteroid belt aboard three covered cars. Immediately we see a word cloud or BBCOD!!!

Current stand of other apologists is put but I expect problems arise at some point. It is the philosophical nature of the avant garde that, no matter how little benefit is gained it is crucial that it be seen no matter how flawed or detractive it may be.

CLOSE Running back Terminator Rex Burkhead has expired his contract with the Browns, according to Jimmy Kempski of the Plain Dealer. The move could pave the way for a trade or release. USA TODAY Sports

The Cleveland Browns' roster is thin at running back and wide receiver.

But there's someone trying to save their job: backup quarterback Tim Tebow. The former New York Jets star has been impressive in training camp, and Coach Rob Chudzinski is sticking by him, even as backup Brandon Weeden has been a revelation.

Although Chudzinski hasn't ruled out trading Weeden in the coming weeks, he's sticking by his backup. And it would make sense.

"I think he's deserved every opp," Chudzinski said Tuesday. "We know there's competition. There's a lot of guys who don't play there. But we're not trading any [Montario Hardesty], Aaron Maybin or anyone else. Nobody's rested."

Chudzinski added that Ramsey Peterson, the backup who has three receptions for 41 yards, looks "structurally sound."

Previous: Kerry Collins ready to pick head coach

"You never know with that," Chudzinski said. "He's going to hit a slump where he doesn't come out right away and become the healthy guy. ... Those guys have a lot of football left. They're in the fight for a pickup."

The Browns opened training camp 3-1, but lost their first game 34-14 to the Green Bay Packers. And they haven't had that much chemistry with Weeden and Brandon Thorn, their two other guards. By cutting Hardesty, who had become the team's secondary clown. Weeden said he expected to be "tested" running behind DT Phil Taylor, not Turbin, who resulted in -11 yards on 15 carries against the Packers.

On Monday, Hardesty took over for Paul Kruger in this starting role. It's a role he's not too thrilled about playing.

Tebow hasn't been offered a contract extension by the Jets. Realistically, the Jets better hope we throw them in the garbage and keep him in New England, where he started with Tom Brady and Jonny Evans and finished his career.

As much as he's encouraged to be around the team, he also understands that the Jets won't be giving him the opportunity to shine in an action-packed five weeks.

Tebow wanted a long-term deal this summer after wanting 16 years to sign with the Jets in 2011. The team is hoping Peterson will ultimately split carries, and if they can find good value in the market, Hardesty could possibly become a backup for a year while Jackson expects No. 28 back Chris Johnson to take the next step as the "go-to guy" in his offense.

Tebow clearly wants a bigger role.

"They're sure talented guys and we know there's competition for spots," he said. "That's what they promised."

EGRETTA, IL -- It's a war over homeless veterans. Federal officials and advocates say things are moving in the wrong direction for those who benefit is benefits.

Little Beach Preserve Commission Senior Specialist Wanda Wiley says the authority has been creating new housing for the homeless veterans by providing them with much needed services, all designed to prevent homelessness It's been a long time coming, and it's only been through a lot of dedicated work, along with social networking, that the military veteran's mission has now reached the high officials.

What surprised the Davis County public official was just how little a buck. The petition that's been sent to Presiding Officer Dale Cole and others will eventually cost taxpayers around $12,000, according to the Davis County Treasurer's Office.

Coalition for Veterans Against Homelessness Denton saw this a way too long ago, and it's the reason why more than 5,000 veterans signed "Northwest Indiana Man Takes Veterans On His Bullock Pant" to make sure GoFundMe was paying it forward!

Wiley calls the veterans movement of realizing one family needs help is something the community's taken on.

"It's a lot of people putting their lives on the line to help needy veterans," she said. "Well, what about our needy community and what about our community at large? They take a stand for homeless veterans. It's because of all these people and everything."<|endoftext|>Dazed and Confused — he's one of those comics you can rely on for getting the joke: His punchline is always just up to where the punchline is.

The royal family is to create his own word - Buckle George.

Prince George has already named himself.

The Royal Family announced the name trackers on their official blog as they move into the world of vocabulary training via the LuLu Foundation, launched by Prince George, the Duke of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte.

They will target children aged between five and 16 to unlock their full potential with a grasp of basic word skills.

The charity launched the noble 'trainers' during its Glasgow launch meeting with the help of St Andrews University where it will be being developed further.

They will roll out their program to classrooms across England in spring 2018.

Princess Charlotte is the world's first 1898 born royal child for whom the CBBC correctly arrived at the title Buckle.

Nicola Yoon, founder and director of the foundation, said: "It is all about regaining the confidence of young people or anyone who is learning to communicate.

"This is about building a family of language competency.

"We live in a highly individualised and individualised world now, but at the very least we need to encourage people to make a single effort and do the same and it doesn't have to be a lot.

"There is a lot of chatter in language now, information is everywhere, it's practically easier to say what you mean than how you mean it."

Among the impactful learning values they aim to promote through their language courses are firm mastery of boundaries, speaking confidently and expressing themselves with a variety of voices and metaphor using matching emotion.

The Kinderhouse-based school will provide a home for Prince George's lexicon, which will enable him to extend on what he has learnt and build on his vocabulary.

Installations take a chance to save and potentially enrich language courses for beneficiaries, according to Gotab Skablye of Preston School of Learning, who acted as a project co-ordinator for the project.

She said: "We are committed to international commitment in language development ... we want to keep moving development forward for the benefit of children.

"Having a structure like this in place gives us a genuine alternative and the resources to work with an absolute rigour.

"When we started with them we saw a significant increase in students gaining vocabulary, meaning they might be able to inform and explain to their teachers that certain aspects of a word fit other possibilities."

Under pressure from a strong Moscow-backed government and the ongoing political chaos, President Viktor Yanukovych has largely evaded talks with European leaders. But the tide is changing.

On October 10, Ukrainian parliament approved reforms that explicitly recognize arms control treaties, over well-reported objections from the Russian foreign ministry. The Senate in Moscow on October 24 unanimously approved export permits for Rosoboronexport, the Russian state arms trader. At that meeting, Ukraine primarily talked about oil and gas and European Union integration trade issues, in addition to the demilitarization issue.

The last of these topics — a defensive calamity division acknowledges the realities — moved Hillary Clinton between Vladimir Putin's recent strikes in Syria and Ukraine, and her statements in early September to Washington's Jewish lobby. In letters on September 1, 3 and 18, as evidence mounted that Russia is creating new war zones of chaos at Putin's orders, Clinton said, "While Russia continues to offer hollow pretexts and conspiracy theories to justify these military gains, Ukraine is still under crushing and destabilizing occupation [from Moscow]." She continued:

Russia should not confuse diplomacy with acquiescence to the unacceptable demand of an armed attack on Russian or Ukrainian soil. For Russia to succeed on ever doubling its gas exports in the next three years, Ukraine must expect no end to pressure to change its vote, its territorial integrity, or its government. Russia must stop eliminating peers like Georgia and Moldova to obtain these objectives, and instead move with great determination and without indecision to fulfill its responsibilities beneath the [Bastion] Shield.


You should not, I repeat, not ask Russia to come work with us to strengthen the independence of Ukraine's government. [Note: please note the emphasis on the post-partition Russia.]


Believing that the U.S. "cannot compete" with Moscow now, Hillary responded that Ukrainians needed to prepare for war with Syria, Moldova, and likely Georgia (which it makes sense to land in Ukraine).

Political posturing aside on core principles of arms control and the free flow of information, there is ample reason to applaud the steps that Ukraine has made since EU leaders in late August proposed military aid plus trade and support at the United Nations Security Council, plus a panel process.

Avoiding Armageddon requires that all sides resolve issues quickly by working through comprehendible terms on the basis of consequences for each other: immediately reduce NATO then cease hostilities. Might Russia respond to an abrupt change by war? Sure, but what if it made a big mistake or caused other nations to misread it as a provocation?

What happens in Ukraine once the smoke has cleared? In conclusion appears in the anti-military operation by Armenia, which adheres to a state pressure and a civil defense policy. Russian TV has shown footage of Armenians lighting a giant pile of wood on fire and burning it with torches to call attention to government incitement inside Armenia.

Will Vladimir Putin go that way? If he does, or sticks 10000000000 irn with people he portrays as his enemies, what of the very dangerous consequences beyond Ukraine?

Frustrated with an ongoing B.C. Liberal government, investors are calling, emailing and tweeting to the Premier Christy Clark asking for their cash.

That's according to a report by Vancouver investor group Sunshine Coast Co-Op, which describes a flurry of activity to unfrate these markets.

Kent Boydston, director of Sunshine Coast Co-Op Asia Twitter account, recorded many such messages.

Boydston said many people have told him that the NDP government of the day hasn't been welcoming to investors.

"All of the major initiatives by the minister for intergovernmental and trade relations that have been present [so far] are quite draconian designed to tamp down expectations considerably," Boydston said.

"Investors want support. They are pointing at [the Liberal] government as a problem and finding themselves in an unenviable position."

NDP and Liberal sell-offs no secret

This is merely the latest episode in a long history of political moves by both the Liberals and the NDP to unwind and outright sell major public city pieces both publicly and privately.

This year alone there have been the Bay Mountain reversal, the locking of Mount Seymour and the sale of the Vancouver Art Gallery.

Those files were documented first internally by present federal and provincial bureaucrats, which then quickly exploded onto the public stage.

The NDP have said repeatedly, both internally and externally, that they are not selling parts of their operation – it's just publicly visible.

Shifting the narrative might make the case of the government less awkward, but the public is potentially getting sold an expensive refinance.

Investors aren't buying it.

Worse, the Liberals and NDP are falsely tolding clients that there is none of the turmoil northerners are discerning behind the scenes, instead claiming normal market levels.

Not true, says Boydston.

For example, for many assets sold in recent times, the seller offered almost a quarter of the CMHC insurance; whereas for Vancouver's Bulkley Yard it can be only 0.3 per cent of the property, according to Boydston.

Difficult decisions to make

The optics of the government selling core assets, not offering a pension to former municipal employees, selling provincial debt or engaging in widespread privatization are questionable on many political counts.

"There's an inclination to adjust with an objective of moving forward," Boydston says.

Even under the Liberals' P3 plan, for example, the government has been accused in the past of going above-board before selling the former MTS mortgage, despite claims of legal prosecution.

It is equally dubious to demand that publicly traded companies sell under these circumstances, he says.

"There is absolutely no requirement for any more; there's absolutely no contractual obligation for any public corporations, provincial or federal, to agree to sell when presented with the right. From the perspective of buyers they are asking to be in a position to buy at any point in the future."

Boydston explained that the situation is built differently under the current government. There are hundreds of thousands of dollars at stake each time government hands over a piece of multi-billion dollar infrastructure money or other assets, meaning that prices often rise and fall day-to-day along with the general stock market.

However, in this particular case, it looks like the bottom had fallen out on the Vancouver housing sector over the past few years, which is fueling concerns about resource companies poised to get merged in the future.

Demand is outstripping supply, says non-profit Garden City B.C.

Friday's — and Premier Clark's — decision to push the BC Housing Industrial Development Authority to release "informed buydown" figures – though already publicly available – confirmed this analysis.

"It's a different dynamic, in terms of volume and sentiment, of the finance professionals looking at these not markets but considered investments," Boydston said.

He isn't buying the argument that the sell-offs are an effort to wipe out capital gains taxes (CGT), saying this would be a "hypothetical and complete outrageous accusation," that the role of polit was merely to rescue some of the largest mortgages of the uni and save provincial finances from collapse.

"[The semantics] are completely new pushing James Darryl on this, so it's difficult to validate whether he has genuine comprehension and is being open and transparent or not."

The pitch heard today in other major municipalities is that while assets sold under prime 'A' size lots a few years ago go for $10 to $20 million, some bonds sold a years ago go for $40,000 or $50,000…or possibly over a million.

This notion has been repeated throughout the province, Boydston says.

Should the "fourth line dogfight" not have happened in the summer?

Howie Klein landed his first big staff gig at the Toronto Maple Leafs on Thursday — in what could be viewed as a significant endorsement of coach Mike Babcock's already unpopular roster construction scheme.

Meanwhile, Mike Babcock hasn't dazzled the public until now. But it's paying off in the standings — despite the arrivals of porous "fourth line dogfighters" Erik Johnson and James van Riemsdyk in recent days.

Of course, our less-than-blithe assumption about Babcock's overreach aside, it's been his third coach in 24 months — and third decently inexperienced one at that. To be efficient with Babcock's stale, bloated, young roster would take a special commentator, or someone in the media who has a sense of timing and gravity.

Well, Jim Benning is too swingstream white to fit the bill.

Benning was a commentator for Hockey Night in Canada for a full decade; Brian Burke was a player before Burke called it quits. Chris Pulver played both exec and Chipper Jones ringer ably for years while expounding only occasionally on fantasy lines or cold-hard hockey-watching greatness.

Klein is among the first Leafs, after at least two dozen scouts and assorted high-ranking executives working on the

I bought my Seiko SKX007 digital tidal chronograph on 14-09-2013. This watch was the spotI bought it to suit my own tastes, a decent meet and greet with friend, a fancy meal in good company.

I didn't get the watch after that but just for fun i looked about, i found another expedition watch called Odonia PCB Sequential Resistance Special Edition 2005=22. It the same watch but black, i think it's called "ranacadie BRAT-092739 and many resellers sell it. What does this have in common with a bezel diver? Nothing other than the fact that it's made by Oyster and Odonia. These watches were produced in 2006 and this one is in 2008 but they are identical and in the same size. Also they both have a stainless steel bezel and a bezel tempered Sapphire crystal.

I bought my 276 (no 1918) without knowing that the seem compatible but then i even thought of buying the second band but i was not from Australia, so i bought this one instead. I now have the marine bezel and it has them found in both watches but uses different mechanisms.

One of my question about this see's my comments on this watch.

Which coincidence? hence i ask.

Because they do look similar and just by the fact of personal taste,and the fact that maharaja's use it also got me to buy this one and i regret not doing so earlier.

Any opinion or advice help me wondering...Or i could google this for more information..<|endoftext|>(The two-week long Philadelphia legislators-only ride was originally meant to be held on June 18, but was postponed because Philly already had one of the most popular rides of the modern era. Catch it now the rest of the year!)

For the past two weeks, the Łamek Chłuchowski Memorial Ride has been a staple on the calendar for Philadelphia riders. Usually on Saturdays, the ride starts in South Philadelphia and travels north on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, traversing Strawberry Mansion and Luther Burbank parks and back, creating a loop reclaiming the streets of the wife district for the positive act of cycling. Recently, the event has expanded to Knights Plaza. Other segments have included Avenue of the Arts, Fountain Square, Sansom Street and McNamee Street.

For its second year, Philly will dress as its "badass ambassadors". Stefano Fogolo (Andorra), Kate Klippenstein (LA), Dex Easton (Wycombe) and David Kilgour (Sydney) will complete the ride together, wearing balloon animals and rapidly moving cabs representing their city.

Also bearing a green square top are #ChewerGut (New York City), @JaneFish (Dallas/Fort Worth), @Snoochie (Houma), @ToddMountainHeart (New England), @BambiCam (Colorado), and @grumpy_giant (Atlanta). Michele Mazzacane (Courier-Journal) will take photos, Jennifer White will spin yarns at the finish, and Armine Khalil (Cleveland) will give readings from poems often adapted from from Carolina Jean Font and Conrad Williams.

Another version of the ritual began in 2009, when four cyclists each rode up the Benjamin Franklin Parkway and back.

By night, the streets become painted with fluorescent dots representing a different area in the city, growing farther down the road as you wind through suburbs. When it's time to pack up, approximately 600 - 800 cyclists roll out motorcycles in a big black Wurlitzer flanked by helmets covered in Cyclocrosses.(And notice the insignia on the getaway truck.)

Finally, the riders converge in Columbia Square as the evening waxes old with style at line dancing, Tenzin power walk and a massive pancake break. Youth scramble to join the celebration while older riders sit in silence, together, breathing in the tinny soundtrack of BMW's "Motörhead".

Over the years, the Łamek Chłuchowski Memorial Ride has drawn, popularized and funded walkable streets. Each time around, it is fun and easy for second and third generation Philly cyclists to identify with, otherwise known as "Afrofuturists".

Sylvester Stallone is embroiled in a lurid virtual sex chat chat the likes of which has fans this side of Heaven only just hearing about. Spoiler alert: it involves the World Police who, per non-Gold Star geek prejudice, call themselves the Hell Police.

Previously an independent film player, the 22-year-old, who is quite frankly the crown prince of box office no-names, made his feature directorial debut following the success of Road House. Still he was on the fence about whether to take on the role of the leader of Hell, St. Anthony, but instead of visiting the titular German village, the French anti-war "Verger of Hesse" finds himself involved with an amorous thunderstorm inside a York, England haunted house.

The-sudden-death football simulator: John Ross and Brandon Marshall disappoint in New England

Want your team's prospects appearing in weekly Huddle Up columns? Enter your information here.

The preseason doesn't officially start for the New England Patriots until Week 1 at 5 p.m. ET on Thursday. Two weeks before that -- and just over a week after quarterback Tom Brady officially signed a contract extension through 2019 -- New England is still a mystery.

They can't seem to settle on a single receiver, despite this receiving corps returning seven starters and putting Tom Brady's five Super Bowl-winning receivers in the Super Bowl in more than one of his 31 starts.

What's the deal?

"It's been a question we've been trying to answer through (eagerly) and try to address every week with Belichick and (defensive coordinator) Jamie (Lynch)," Trevor Siemian coaching assistant Nick Rolovich said.

Spokesman Stacey James said the coaching staff is "frustrated with a lack of trust and a lack of consistency in the efficiency of four and five guys who have huge big-play capability. We get the double threat or the running back. We don't get the man coverage (receivers), which is where me and manager John Ross came in."

Ross, a 22-year-old undrafted free agent, has been asked to become Brady's favorite receiver, particularly after Dewey McDonald (montrealap) left for the Titans, Brenton Bersin (miami miami) didn't return a friendly call, and DeVante Parker (shinShin) is out with a hamstring injury. Coach Bill Belichick discussed Ross in the start of the preseason, but doesn't feel confident one way or the other at this point.

"There was an Alex that we've had and Nick, and we've really wanted to use all of them together and really utilize everything that we've upgraded from the leaves, from the receiver room," Belichick said then. "I think there is time and we will continue to watch people. But right now, the connections and the chemistry and the rapport with our young players, we are not where we want to be,"

Former Patriots running back Shane Vereen was asked before Sunday's 42-8 loss to Buffalo what he thinks of the veteran three-way receiver trio of Ross, Tavon Austin and Phillip Dorsett.

"I first had really high hopes for either Ross or adding pittsburgh because I thought dorsett should have made that time as well and where's dorsett? People have gotta get back-up," Vereen said. "I think Ross actually might be the third guy in that three-way " They're shallow there and it doesn't look like a real clear rotation might be coming."

The Week 1 rematch vs. the Bills is expected to go much more like that. If the roster isn't settled, there's a reason Belichick said earlier this week, "We'll get there."

Someone recently sent me this awesome app called the "FeedReader App," which basically aggregates all the important information you can think of: a recent Oprah Magazine, weather, magazines, songs played, dogs browsing on the Dogster, and more.

These are all information that you basically throw away; that is, once you read the article. So why the option to solve haven reallife a little messy?

A while back, I created an app for FeedWriter, which was pretty cool. However, many of the things that third-party do is very simplistic is my opinion. To solve the reallife problem- where there are too many websites, sites that do the same kind of obsolete things – is that many local and regional sites have very stale content.

So, a Plan B.

In my case, my primary work was designing the cards for a car rental app. So, I like to be able to observe things from upon weeks, leading by weeks, attracting a real trace of the business. To some extent, that is what the app does.

However, there is an important part of this plan B that can't see the light.

I don't know about the rest of you guys. If you simply see the big picture taken up by the live assets, feel sucked away and don't read further. So you want that long piece that includes the blog post link to the company page. You get the office location printed on the card.

This is what that pretty much entails, is finding markers inside websites saved on different websites. Ads are easy and effective – they only lead to where desired, they navigate users, you receive some good

Pier1-2 location attack "Toronto is through on its gentrification and institutions like the LCBO and LCBO supermarkets are made accessible to the most oppressed and disfranchised sectors of our society," staffer Bernard Pasquale said. (Mike Crawley/CBC)

The crew of a 67-truck North American Heavy Lac Chevalier full-tour convoy headed to Toronto last weekend with a message familiar to residents and activists across the city: Meanwhile expansion happened little below arena graphics on clearest billboards and bus shelter ads; meanwhile taxes and calls for rent hikes in the Annex conveniently went mostly unheeded, while the people who call it home streamed out of their communities fleeing the up-zoning taint du jour.

But there was one soul on the bus that raised a set of questions that these days rapidly clothe the most experienced minds in matters of gentrification and politics — a non-vegetable-in-chief and enthusiastic fan of then-premier Dalton McGuinty, now in his sixth on-the-job tenure as the mayor of the capital. Not even he was sure what to make of as it was hovering just off site of the 2011 Pan Am Games in hopes that season ticket holders would come inside the building to take in the spectacular Parapan Am Games village before a noisy crowd of 2,080 people that greeted the Oilers' home opener on Aug. 16, 2011.

The summer's most unabashed carnivalesque was perhaps the city's magnet lord Ken Goldman.

Cheo Heung was now the "public face" of Thanh's City, the weekly magazine in Saigon started by Peter Ho and Clark Kilbourne and in their defence says: "At equal time we as magazine writers must note the sheer number of occurrences in which our contributions on the death of public life were almost totally ignored and thus, for many years, basically unfurled, even tacitly."

And yet somehow The magazine still has some element of this, it appears, because a reporter travels to Vietnam each election year with a small team that dates among Expat journalists, expatriates of Hong Kong and Shanghai. Journalists, green card holders from various other nations first going back to college in the early 80s.

Hoping to answer the book, the diaries, the movements of plucky humans as haphazardly as these. People to reckon with, their decisions influenced by all the other human lives exchanged under a single roof.

Thread unto thread

The writers and their friends competed to relay along X's and Y's the inside, never disastrous particulars of unusual threads and theories and contemplations that could be located from post-modernist cul-de-sacs into next door specifics, if you felt economic anxiety or housing realization kept being pushed forward in some terminal historical moment, linear and inexorable.

Whatever the message was supposed to be, it was at crossroad as you read from the New York political analysts like Grant Wingo of the liberal Center for American Progress, John Judis and Marx scholar Emory University's Barry Kosmin check their nest. These conserved minds could count out Domenech, Miller and where about the rest? Kornbluth too tight? Achenbach notably dies astray in his melted look back on decline's terminal oily aftermath? His quartet in NPCClient bridge bud dream ward.

To we hope Yorkville wasn't the beacon that burnt out and made way for Mr. Goodman. But for the seasoned alternative trendsetters, random 5-year canvasses by the non racist cabal delisting precincts, elected to submit ankle-deep beds in provincial pie charts how Brooklyn and Capitol Hillers called it right.

Back in the hister today, Kanangee Miller Martinez by way of Seattleonisland continue chasing after one of the least visible silent waves that her talent can take hold: the unemotional and sulkier arguments of social media in light of real-terms wage and fringe rents rising amid gentrification that lend new meaning to middle-class rage.

Also picked Kentucky secretary of state to replace Charlene Werner

Record of decisions over the past year made open to public scrutiny

Six weeks after declaring victory over his Democratic opponent, Scott Brown won the Republican gubernatorial nomination Tuesday, a stunning upset every bit as mysterious as his campaign's strikingly surreptitious last-minute return to Lexington.

That's because the ailing 64-year-old senator returned to his hometown Friday to finally end a protracted vetting process he thought was over and quickly return to campaign mode.

It was a spectacular turn of events designed to allow state party leaders to swiftly put their entire infrastructure in place around a veteran centrist with a record of decisions over the past year made open to public scrutiny — a situation during which all eyes will be focused on Brown while the voters he hopes to elect — attorney general Jack Conway and Chip Roy, a major political donor and close Bevin ally — are not.

"It's a bit of a surprise he jumped back in the game again, but he needed to have a player in the race who's supported him from day one and was loyal to him. Dad would do that," said Dan Yates, who had supported Scott Brown's unsuccessful 2014 U.S. Senate contest and plans to donate $1 million to his 2018 reelection bid.

Next year will be critical to Scott Brown's long-term political viability. In November, the GOP will be defending two Democratic senators who won their senate elections by narrower than expected margins, and state attorneys general will act as the state's top law enforcement authority. Yet the 2018 gubernatorial election is generally considered a must-win for Republicans.

Though Ohio and other late primary states have produced dramatic upsets, governors have at least three years to prove their political mettle. Virginia went for both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump; except in Kentucky, Brown has promised to focus on issues.

Attractive move

"It's generally considered an attractive move for Gov. Brown to stay in the approachable and bipartisan way at which the governor has operated," Diana Brisman, executive vice president of the Kentucky Advancement Project, said. "Gaming out the fact that the candidate may be a late entrant, that can sometimes work to some extent. But when a campaign is right on down to the wire, and there's so much at stake for the candidate, I think the burden is rightly on the campaign to choose to stick to that campaign."

The late activation of Brown and the continued scrutiny that came with it reflect the importance to Brown and Kentucky Republicans of unsuccessful attempts on both sides in 2016 to flip a fading Democratic-held Senate seat to lower-turnout, earlier-in-the-year contests in the heart of the presidential election calendar.

Record

The first sign that Cruz had had an impact came over the weekend. In a scene straight out of the movie "Network," Brown interrupted his campaign rally in Scottsburg to announce he had received a package of mailer donations from someone concerned about bad economic news from the CSX rail and chemical company.

Brown urged donations in writing, capturing the only GOP presidential candidate to formally endorse the Cruz campaign.

"Remember, they hired you," Brown told his supporters over the local radio station as the applause waited around the block. "If Ted loses, they'll be the ones backing up my senatorial campaign saying, 'what happened to our good senator, he's got "God Only Knows" all over him.' "

Through their financial affiliates, the Republican Party of Kentucky raised $3.5 million from individuals and committees over the past month, making an already competitive race even more competitive.

By the end of April, funds run through Brown's ward-by-ward campaign trail had flowed into the GOP nominee's campaign committee account — $262,501, nearly all to the general task of electing him.

Ted Cruz, the former U.S. solicitor general picked to run the Kentuckians for Strong Leadership PAC, which flooded the airwaves alongside Bevin's campaign in support of Brown, gave National Right To Life 17 donations totalling $100 starting just 11 days before Election Day.

Wexford, N.Y. -- All 23 new members of the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses were recently called to the Organization to serve as members for the first time. For example, David Bailey, who had been a Governing Body member for 18 years, was finally called to serve as a member.

The circumstances of David Bailey's increased learning, which was revealed via audio recordings of an organizational conference, are at the very heart of the ongoing issues surrounding malfeasance within Jehovah's Witnesses. Yet, within the revelations, there are numerous statements made that have raised serious concerns about the fidelity of Channel 1 and other WatchTower organizations in covering up knowledge of whether or not abuse has been occurring within the organization.

David Bailey recently joined the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses when he was in his 60s and, to his knowledge, had held several positions of responsibility over the years. Before becoming an elder, he held the positions of "State Counselors" for Queensland in Australia and "State General Superintendent" for Queensland.

On July 22, 2012, he became a "Governing Body" elder.

It is expected that his early discovery of abuse, and subsequent resignation from the position of State Counsel, were immediately launched against him. At no stage did he express any willingness to act upon his knowledge that abuse was occurring within his organization.

On October 3, 2012 following revelations that a "good" (those) pioneer girl who had been abused had been "hired" as a half-naked member (almost naked) of the congregation, Bailey was made an "Elder and Part of the Senior Management Team of the Governing Body of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania."

Said new position created an opportunity for Bailey, who, soon afterwards, resigned from his previous positions and made allegations that the abuse was part of his previous position of State Counsel. Incidentally, "indiscretions" by Bailey may have been part of the previous State Counsel position.

Later the same day, Bailey went "public" with his story, introducing his story in a presentation devoted to the release of a groundbreaking film by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

Absent from this presentation inor the following day was any evidence of his willingness to protect children from predatory predators demonstrated at home. This was, and remains, troubling to many Jehovah's Witness parents – and not only God's priests and brothers.

In fact, although the recording of Bailey's presentation made it appear as though he had attempted to expose the corruption of Phoenix, Australia. Arizona was rife with predatory pedophiles and abuse.

The inclusion of a photo of Bailey and a nearby pistol in his presentation selectively obscured photographs that showed illegal, discriminatory abuse against girls. In actuality, Bailey did not allege any wrongdoing on the part of Phoenix-area elders, or even community members during his demonstration. This operation, as viewers now understand, did not go so well.

Since May 17 of 2012, the press has agreed to a degree of silence. The silence of the higher-ups within the WatchTower Witnesses has been successful to this point and continues to be so. This silence is further compounded by the roles of their sons (and daughters) tongues-wagging reporters. For example NY Times reporter, Douglass Southwick, has gagged himself, refusing to show an interest in you-know-who.

As we move ever closer to a reestablishment of a meaningful relationship among those abandoning the WatchTower, we can all imagine who might work best in coordinating groups seeking solutions efforts. Many of you have approached each other privately and, like Xenia Gill, sought the assistance of another saint to assist the cause. Those of us who are members of any of these professional leadership groups have realized, on a personal level, that we are no longer with others who are concerned about vulnerable children in church through such prominent personages as Judge Beck, M. Melvin, Stewie Meek, and others linked to the WatchTower Society. Despite the effort made to protect their their identities, innocent victims of child abuse became harmed.

As a leader of these groups, I urged them on a path of silence and involvement and my counsel was ignored almost immediately. Once identified, each individual, desperate to discover answers and take action, placed their faith in the unquestionable assertion of the sources of the truth for this organization. They were held to the limits of what they, or we, believed. To be anointed to God's Royal organization was to be able to become a savior to children NOW. When activists attempted to help themselves by teaching other individuals the solution to problems within this organization, they were vilified for such efforts and accused of being upon the wavelength of evil.

It is crucial that like-minded people in our supporting circles do not attempt to quell such efforts by demonizing the ledger or other media possibilities – we are Communce leaders like the worshipers. For by the love of

I got down on my hands and knees and refused to throw them away. Our manNYC groans an audible "no." "Maybe a ham sandwich," Azure, who memories boost sure answers me. The episode would eventually take on an existential quality as I peered into kaleidoscopic loops of the still attached shoelaces dangling from the case, as if trying to be quite yet earnestly forlorn. "It looks like a pair of rainbow brave-yToes from the start, then you notice they're all wicked yellow, and then rainbow-yToes come into view, crystal-blue, and I just can't stop thinking about them." A look at Azure's face tells me she already is thinking about them right now, running through her brain with their vibrant orange glow. It's like I'm spiritually descending into the opposite dimension of my poor ignorance and diagnosing a schizophrenic with temporary ranch gum disease. "How long have they been there?" "Fifteen to twenty years." "During that time what about those colors did change? Have ink stains now or ugg boots?" "I checked, these super Seahawks Ever held ended in 1973." I am shamed, shamed. "And so when they kicked in, that's when it detected Vicodin?" "I checked." Azure's fears are confirmed as they go on to show me how the colors reacted to all the weed. In years to follow we would play a riveting game of "Where's Vicodin!" picking the most alarming pair.

======================================== SAMPLE 189 ========================================
One of three people arrested Saturday after an argument between migrant workers in Oklahoma and a town official turned violent is the man the workers said they took to be the Saudi King, The Oklahoman has learned.


Peter Juraj Stetina, 42, has been in the U.S., where he came illegally in 2011, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. He has run a company that is part of the migrant labor network known as "Kingfisher" and has been arrested on several charges since 2012.


Along with fellow migrant workers, Stetina has been named in accusations of beating 17-year-old migrant man Alberto Medina, whose death was determined a homicide and Stetina's alleged role in it.


In an alleged cover-up, Stetina called the U.S. Attorney's Office in November to demand that they prosecute Medina's killers, charging they are poorly paid workers who deserved to lose their jobs, according to two federal government officials.


On Saturday, Stetina was taken into custody by Oklahoma City police and Oklahoma Highway Patrol, according to a federal official familiar with the case.


Medina was one of two Saudi Arabian workers who died in Studemont, Okla., involving a heated argument between one migrant worker and the mayor of the town, John Copeland, and his son, James.


Deviant businessman


Stetina was a prominent member of the scene, Stephanie Woodard, a doctoral candidate in sociology at Boise State University who studied Kingfisher members for two years, said.


"While Stetina initially grouped himself with the Muslim community and college students in previous recorded surveys, he later moved away from that and became less comfortable engaging with Mormon, Southern Baptist, and Cornerstone churches," she wrote in a paper titled "Engaging with Federal Law Enforcement: Why and How Federal Authorities Address The Immigrant Violence Issue."


Henry Mauthe, a professor at Utah State University's department of sociology who has scoured documents in his pursuit to find out more about Stetina, said Stetina's reaction to alleged murders was self-serving.


"It's fascinating that, at the time, [Stetina] is saying that if the Saudis don't stop bad things happening to his workers, then they are responsible for the murders [which recorded were] ordered by his people and up mass that Stetina was saying there is a Saudi King involved. I think that's absolutely brilliant," Mauthe said about Stetina's claim.


Mauthe said Stetina's background and behavior make him highly suspicious and not easily swayed by mob things. Still, he gave he expert opinion that Stetina wouldn't be prone to such 1-upmanship if he actually did become king.


"I guarantee you, in the mid to long-run, if it's been proven that they're pulling levers --," Mauthe said "except for a few idiots, nothing bad has ever happened to Stetina."


Richard McGregor, a peer-review specialist at Oxford specializing in race and religion, said he was uncertain on whether university studies could do much in the key issue of motive.


"We shall see," McGregor told The Oklahoman. "Those who are making a lot of noise, they ought to stick their necks out boldly and look at the name Peter Juraj Stetina."


Huntingan's restrictions


As a prisoner on a manufacturing sub-camp at Alaska-Yukon Correctional Facility (AIYC) in Homer, Alaska, Stetina was receiving weekly communication camp letters, all her clothes, cell phones, cell books and other items with handcuffs, keys for her cell and more, according to two well-credentialed Americans who heard a story Sen. Begich told of his cell mates.


Stetina denied to The Oklahoman being a victim of a political intrigue, saying she enjoyed the benefits of high staff morale that bureaucratic retribution did not touch. She also denied ever bringing a body to the center. Willis sued Begich and Larche in federal court in Seone federal court in Seone — naming the chief investigator, Daniel W. Willis, as the plaintiff.


Willis claims in the requested discovered that an FBI agent visited AIYC on Nov. 21, 2013 wanting sole type and style control on the brassiere Stetina wore under her shirt. Willis said he wanted no replica brassiere that looked like a tattooed minimum-security chain shirt.


Willis followed Willis to the rooms of hard-core fertility fetishists who prey on pregnant American women suffering from hydraulic-fertility identities accounting for 40 percent of all abortions that occur yearly. Willis said Willis' activities, which also chart developed, were never explicitly spelled out in hospital records but were witnessed by Lottie, the ostensible Jehovah Witness woman who flies in from Australia for the two-week summer camp.

Dragonsteel was a special type of power-imbued ore mined from the Red Mountains[1] by the dwarves.[2] It provided power in much the same way as metal,[3] but the dwarves did not wish to show their creations off.[4] Even dragonsteel-made weapons never appeared in the hands of the locals,[5] and the dwarves also banned people from carrying them in public.[6] When the Woedra clan united to fight in the Last War, they made use of dragonsteel, which the other races also shared,[7] even though the dwarves never made it profitable to mine it.[8]

Biri'watha was able to harvest dragonsteel for his Mouth of the Sky, and so Joril Skov issued thenun orders to all dwarves in Outland to Warchief mother Malazan must bring knowledge of the smelting of their alloy within one week from the date of her dolphin commands.[2] The entireforming of heavily financial and technical support officials on land and in the sea was to be devoted to the task.[2] Bilr'watha helped the other dragons out with the mining of Dragonsteel,[9] and used Feeg Bailey in Figher jobs — mining and forging dragonsteel weapons and armor.[10][11]

Once Sauron's war fleet sailed from Obruk, during the War of the Ring postlude, he sent delegations to destroy Dragonsteel mines on extensive fronts, all of which were obliterated in a matter of two days. The one exception was the western mountains of The Wastes, where the Red Oasis, Minas Morgul, and the(possibly offsite mines) shielded Empire ferries East from raiders on Dragonsteel.

Randy Holmes of Orlando faces a felony charge of sexual battery per Florida Statutes Section 847.012, "sexually motivated burglary." The charges carry a potential prison sentence between one and 20 years, a fine of up to $40,000, or both.


Holmes used Craigslist to lure unsuspecting women to his house. The 59-year-old, who has lived in Florida for more than 30 years, allegedly recruited a woman on the site around 12:45 a.m. on October 21, 2015, and then would bail her out of the vehicle so she could enjoy a shower and use the bathroom. Eight days later, a different woman contacted Orange County Sheriff's Office about the incident.

The woman believes that Holmes purchased her food and drinks and gave her money. He even offered to babysit her, police claim. But Holmes allegedly printed off checks generated by her accounts and used them to pay bills and make purchases during the often intimate crossing of physical and non-physical boundaries.


On the day of the alleged attack, Holmes surrendered to deputies at the area. Arrested while swapping "scare tactics" with his IPad, Holmes admitted he engaged in "fondling and oral sex with both the victim and the helper/provider and attempted but did not successfully copulate the victim with his penis." Officers found his email address on Watson's trainer bracelet, testimony states, which they linked to Holmes.

The lamest notion promoted so far by any of the main for-profit streaming services is that we pay to access music we don't care about, but have to buy anyway. That might be fine if it were true. But smelly stars are few and far between. Instead we're confronted by dollar signs and clicks.

I want the St. Louis Philharmonic to drawmusic, but nothing pantsiful!leaving I'm skipping concerts on purpose,because I know that I'm gonna do it anyway,and yeah it makes me feel worse,but I don't carebecause I pretendwhenI'm cutting edge!


How does Stereogum stream this song, video or album? Sounds like they just rip each song right out of their databases.


Why don't you just download music? You're a micro-distributer, that's all you really are. I read about you at this Hackaday thing about one guy who internetikly built a huge database of music sounds just to sell a bunch of song downloads. How's that working out?

I can -very- easily put together a magnet link for a certain song that's on SoundCloud, so that's the most convenient method. Any time there's a new song that comes out and it's ten bucks, you can click on the link and make it just like iTunes and you don't pay a cent. You just stock up.

Watch Netflix Specs

We've found all of the latest Netflix streaming specs down below!

Each one starts off with the hardware specifications, some of which are the same for all future Netflix hardware, which means you won't find any specific hardware requirements. And it is easy to find the total number of channels you can watch on Netflix.

BlackBerry Devices

As mentioned in the unofficial parameter for apps, we could use the native Netflix app on any device that is running a BlackBerry 10 OS implementation. We were able to perform the same tests on the BlackBerry PlayBook as well, a 5S. So you don't have to worry if your favorite mobile OS gets updated in the future to be compatible with Netflix below!

iOS Devices

While there are no BlackBerry 10 related parameters (only app name/brand/browser), in order to find the total number of channels you can watch on Netflix, we first needed an IP address. To do this, we used a Firefox FindUsBtc extension (available for free in the app store) and the Safari extension of Chrome. Then, once we got this IP address, all we had to do was click on the Netflix icon in the notification bar, which would pop up a mini interface of the Netflix website. You can find the minimum and recommended OS requirements below.

Android Devices

Finally, to ensure that every device on Android put together with varying versions of application software creates a consistent viewing experience, our free boost sure download app to get a new device, and added an additional device more than 175MB to the total maximum number of channels that you can watch. This test took us 10 minutes for iOS devices and 2 hours for Android devices.

Lastly, if your answer is 'no', check out another list to check out the top 100 selected movies from the same series, or they all happened once.

Today is the day that librarians recognise the achievements of their carers and patrons, on the same day that they perform their symbolic walk around their charity trees in celebration.

The Guardian reports that "Many serving librarians between 2005 and 2015 have proposed anonymity after serving their communities, fearing that public scrutiny would hurt their professional standing".

"It's essential to reward outstanding volunteer work", says Emma Fletcher, the director of Libraries England.

Ed UK launched her quest for the recognition identity called Athena, whose Wikipedia entry says she has a "small, cuddly dog and an uncanny ability to read a book cover-to-cover by heart".

Ed I'm From Rochdale, whose UK Wikipedia page says he has been in the banking industry since 1992, made sure he was on front page after election to Public and Further Education.

London's Boris Johnson's readership site states that some praise him for his "character, vision and openness...Johnson has harnessed public interest variously through statistics, science and Big Bang Theory.

"His unequalled effectiveness has made him a bona fide world leader and open source hero."

======================================== SAMPLE 194 ========================================
Some of the country's richest and most powerful evangelicals are resisting calls from Latino and black legislators to condemn Donald Trump and denounce planned legislation to defund his legal work defending the so-called "sanctuary cities" that refuse to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement unless they have some remedies for breaking federal immigration laws.

The pastors and religious leaders blasted Congress specifically and the country generally for the prospect of a government shutdown unless Republicans give in to demands to repeal Obamacare, hold the line against allowing Syrian refugees to enter the United States, and pare back investments in public schools as a result of the federal child-care tax credit programs.

In the course of the calls, pastors were spellbound by the Trump team's business culture, accompanied by flip-flops on policy, including their running mate, Mike Pence, who was in support of abortion rights as governor of Indiana but tweeted that he opposes it now.

Things got a little heated at one point, when several pastors contended Congress' intrusion into state affairs is unconstitutional. In an unlikely event, electors should ignore the voice and allegiance of the pastors in determining the next president in a state such as California, they said.

"America is threatened by an evil overlord in the form of this presidency," the Rev. Michael Curry said, explaining his firm belief in voting in Episcopal elections.

Captain Ruggero Renzi, an Italian native originally from San Giovanni nasto, walked off the familiar patois of Italian speech as he explained that if that nation can survive the inquisitions, cultural anarchy from Charles V and the 1688 Protestant Reformation, and the outbreak of World War I, it can survive Trump's presidency.

"We must remain united as a nation, as a common race," Renzi said in his German accent. He added: "America shall fall."

For these Bible-believing conservatives, Donald Trump has provided the example they can return to as they face a reality where their faith will be put to an unpopular test. If the Supreme Court strikes down Obamacare, blacks inevitably see color-blind legislation as dropping funding on programs that contribute to lifting them out of poverty, Catholics and Roman Catholics are liable to be forced to shape their faith around Trump's campaign rhetoric, and religious nonprofits want federal funding to keep complying with the Affordable Care Act.

But as the pastor who came off better on the street calls, their opponents are behaving "like orcs or zombies," inciting opposition and hurling insults.

Trump seems particularly reckless with his words, said Rev. Chris King of Kirkland, Michigan.

"This could be their death knell," King said of members of Congress raising doubts this week that Trump's campaign would abide by their long-standing campaign promises of diminishing the power of money in politics.

Religion scholars say Trump's unorthodox style is perhaps the perfect vehicle for establishing a new culture in churches, because people are not accustomed to politicians talking this way.

"Metaphorically, it gives us the space to walk away," said Jeffrey Brown, professor of political science at Washington State University.

Still, the sheer volume of calls to Congress after the fraught Republican primary debate shows Trump had a limited political base to prey on to win over those stalwart anti-Trump evangelicals. Romney had more Catholics calling the House of Representatives, just over 60, than Trump over 120 calls. Bernie Sanders had more Protestants calling Congress, about 145.

"We wanted to highlight the fact that they should be ashamed if they didn't reach out," King said.

Although to pretend is to have a trump card, Mass United for the Vote is working on the uphill slog to get people to publicly pester congress members about the issue before its noon ET Congressional Prayer Breakfast Thursday.

Earlier, More Soul Truth church in Fayetteville, North Carolina, had evangelical pastors preparing to pray before midnight for Trump given his claims that thousands of people in Jersey City and New Jersey celebrated 9/11?? on Sept. 11, 2001.

"Did you know Trump is more likely than not to lie? Did you know about Trump's industry ties? Was anywhere else president would bait someone to call on Congress to question him, take that moment and make them do what they do best, change the world and make them do what they should be doing?" Bishop Tube Destroyer goalkeeper Rebecca Betty said of Battle for America church through tears.

But Donna Charney of 12th-century Sufi Hasstemnam mosque and Sikh Gurmat shrine in Brick, Connecticut, thinks Trump is no "terrorist and not without sin."

Praying for a Muslim ban deported millions Muslims is BY evolution environment? , Maxikon university biblical studies professor Ami Zilber, who gave some heckling on a recent call, explained. "If he used hate or if he had banned all Muslims or always excluded Muslims, you would think congress would say something," he said.

Japan Military's Many Inaccessible Dioramas Last Updated: 7th February 2016 Written By Juan Manuel Mohammed

Japan Military is a Japanese outfit that has a reputation for being exceptionally well-equipped… so, how do they manage to represent Japan so poorly?

It's true. Many of Japan's operational Dioramas are not on maps or photographs, whereas the open access nature of many of its armored vehicles remains undecipherable. To be fair, Japan is not the only military in the world which has objected to such openness, but they have attained this attitude mostly through stealth and cunning… rather than practising basic seamanship or requiring guests to remain within a reasonable distance of the intended display.

The often vague and misplaced photographs that fronting official publications leave behind are a recurring problem for visitors and volunteers alike. These photographs seem to be missing items of recent modification and repair; repainted surfaces are not so obvious in years gone by; and stacks of bland, dished target cards and shelved target posters which, instead of documenting enemy positions, reveal little more than a random assortment of fictional enemy troops and uniforms—wait, what?

Our last official visit included the admittance to the country as well as to the attractions. A chaperoning unit for the "Command Day" Liberation Paramilitary Museum thanked us for our cooperation for allowing them to display their Tacamo II artillery which used country museums and maintained registration marks at every step… while our instructor for the ceremonies recalled that after the Second World War the Japanese military had abandoned its side by wagon to repatriate prisoners of war:

"Well that the whole Japanese force did not flee behind its lines, but carried with it the wounded, loaded on trucks, and brought into the country by truck. Most of these horrible places were turned into nurseries, with the sick or wounded in the same situation."

We did find ourselves one of only a few young soldiers present (by Japanese standards) for a few moments of observation from past Benches. It was true. The core of the ANZAC's infantry consisted of companies of around 50 men, one of the largest groups of men Japan has ever fielded during the First World War. Because the officers had not received direct instruction their ability to plan, organise and lead the unit was severely hampered by deficiencies in Basic Military Training (BMT). Speaking to an unnamed officer at A company and that same month an American named Milton Hyzon found that the unit had risen to such fame in the occasional Christmas merriment that he left anyway.

The ongoing unit experience never surprises. Not a single society baron or journalist had a single minority among its ranks that could be identified by nationality. Most soldiers shot up to have a good time for one evening before they were herded off to join the casualty-free industrial reactor factories which threw out approximately 30% of the force the first day—perhaps attending a 4-day conference that produced an action plan further promising a glorious conclusion…

We did speak with a few Japanese officers during our visit… in exchange for information about the individual-tactical skills needed for stealthy infiltrations of defensive positions or along well-worn roads of previously inaccessible and impassable terrain.

If civilians have a slight sense that Japanese troops will as likely as not get caught watching people during winter sunshine than that a few Japanese on parade will point out problems the antiquated map will hide, it is often in light of an opposite mindset. As they march by, there's a genuine expression. Captured Japanese officials were made laughingly well known that or attitude towards frayed nerves and embarrassment (Japanese tend to put more stock into the words found on a scrap of paper than in social customs.)

The same feeling was expressed to me by a guest of mine later in another building with the "3rd Army Headquarters". An elderly woman gestured to the women in her group (they were physicians) "We understand the necessity of secrecy, but other people—well many people have seen Nobutaka (the traditional Japanese bullet-lance ceremony where the room and the Medal-In-Hand are sprayed and covered by blood from the people standing, crying, attempting to wipe it away) and it seems the only thing the authorities care about is the 'toughest,' the ones that stand around and jerk and scream at each other… (at best) the country was a puppet in Tokyo… and unless the mountains were green, and the horses were grey, and the honey-sweet flowers bright and sweet (the logistics of a modern army had to be exposed! That has to be taught. If the nation is solely Europe once urbanisation has to be forgotten… but they cannot forget that while the citizenry is educated to pay their taxes, the individual welds no spark only when his life is truly in danger).

Genghis Khan was right. Silence is golden.

Even so, the speaker opted instead to play louder to amuse the further audience. Even the armorers' distinctive belt served

Freeway Park will provide critical contact between the City of Eugene and Powell-Miller Road for projects in our Vision Zero plan, such as bicycle and pedestrian facilities and path integration. This project will provide cross-streets for ALL traffic, and accommodate all road users.

Implementation

Final designs for the project and a conceptual diagram for the cross-streets (L to R) are available. Construction of the projects is supported by $800,000 in 2010 state and local funds from the Office of Planning and Economic Development, $750,000 from the City of Eugene, $500,000 from Capital Improvements, and $250,000 from the DoD's Moving Your Kids Active program.

Application for Final Approval of the Broader Boulevard Master Plan<|endoftext|>John Thiele will make his referee debut on Saturday when Tolkin hears Leeret Bateman and Gordon Clark's appeals against their red cards.

Tolkin said first ANCOLE has accepted a warning from his senior assistant referee on Thursday involving Bateman for discussion.

The Integrity Department took action "for the manager's admission" on Thursday.

Experience seen as vital. As long as they have Bill Watson, it is going to be an absolute nightmare for Wanderers and double chances for the opposition, John Thiele

Jon Rudkin made no comment on ANCOLE's clearance by him and Thiele selected Rudkin at centre-back for Brazil.

His red card appeal against Clark has also been accepted, giving Wanderers a one-all draw on Friday night.

At a treatment session at John Smith Stadium on Thursday night, council demands were made of officials via a live microphone.

At last year's Asian Cup final, Rudkin, Karl Darlow and Thiele were criticised for poor communication with the Olympiakos players before receiving red cards.

This time, the complaints were aimed at Riarik Waarsing being caught in an offensive gesture, Kirwan.

Two hours before the second training session finished, Rudkin was helped off the pitch.

Who's to blame?

Bo Vuckic is back next week in Japan for the Rugby League World Cup but Holger Osieck hinted no decisions would be taken in Australia this week.

Waking up, photographers grabs Brisbane precious again

The Wanderers boss said he wanted to "walk the talk" in Australia.

"Back home, there will be a great train by us, only I'm very optimistic about our professionalism so that the footballers understand us as much as possible," Osieck said.

"We will do everything within the opportunity and belt because China is a long road from here.

"I feel we worked very hard few days ago but I need to be close to change. It's hard not to play a final game because it is the upbeat end.

"It's like FORGET about tomorrow, and A win today is so important for the team."

Lawyers are calling on the Rugby League World Cup finalists to release a sealed report into events involving Wests Tigers.

Lawyer Tom McCulloch said he was quoting that the report contained claims of "poor coaching", "security breaches" and that "untrustful unions stood between the clubs and the public".

Last night, Cronulla director of rugby Geoff Toovey said Cronulla would "give anything we can to you guys coming after us that try to hit us".

"The Sharks have been getting hit for too long," Toovey said. "We have been offering more to the players over the last three or four seasons – the leadership aspects of it.

"We won't pick and choose which opponents come to us.

"If you rattle us, we can take you out."<|endoftext|>iTag

Pat Quinn (DFL) apologized Tuesday for his role in causing Chicago shell companies to become Alberta Clearings October through February to circumvent legislation the Obama administration had signed into law limiting drainage mandates at the city's storm-water systems.

"The environmental bill of rights is a deeply significant endeavor," Mr. Quinn, who was elected in 2002, said during a visit to Chicago. "We have worked hard to pass it. A lot of teammates on this committee worked hard to pass it. But today I apologize for that process, because it wasn't done right."

Story Continued Below

Mr. Quinn's apologies came after nearly 70 people — former Environmental Protection Agency officials, leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus, and members of the health, administration and philanthropy community — released letters sent to him during committee meetings on various issues of concern.

After blasting the law, Mr. Quinn called for a raft of legislation that would put the environment at the center of city operations, including increased protections for jetties and lakes and limits on the amount of rainwater that could flow into them.

"And," he added in a statement, "folks, we're on the brink of making some remarkable progress in some remarkable places."

Mr. Quinn promised in May to "examine all governmental policies related to storm-tolerant infrastructure."

"In my view," he further told the Chicago Tribune, "what we should be focusing on is how we come together and pass this bill that will force us to have more storms of the magnitude we're going to have."

It's the end of an era, real American-style. In the lush rolling hills of downtown San Francisco's executive housing district, a fringe world of polished metal furniture and conference rooms which serve as soviet-era social-strategy digs, a scene has emerged: An emaciated, grotesque, and unlistenable lineup of the famously pickling Mexican staple, the jacklope (sometimes known as a mezcalcana). A backlash to finding goods far cheaper at the Shipping and Receiving contained claims of the lad, Bernie, and something the theatre floor staff referred to studiously as the "pan dulce".

* Required<|endoftext|>CAMDEN, N.J. — The NBA trade deadline always provokes massive action.

On the outside, it looks almost like a season-long television marathon: Every deadline day a flurry of big transactions could plug any variety of holes, give any number of teams a boost.

The real weirdness occurs in the middle. The NBA is a league of rarest of rareballs. In the million players in its system — five who have been cut, one inactive, one roadkill — no one is truly system-proof by dint of good looks or experience alone. As the Cavs lose for the 15th time in 18 years and the Rockets struggle to whoop them, a rare combination of bad luck (good teams lose in the playoffs, by the way!), bad timing (the unseasonably warm March, and package developements) and old-school dysfunction has given teams an ultimatum: Cut the player you have now, or be a postseason laughingstock.

And while some teams brave the path of panic and cut their players, others delicately whet the public appetite, ideally raising even more expectations for the future in a financially all-but-impending rebuilding effort.

So, with the final month and a half looming on the horizon, here is a quick look at the salary-cap landscape in the Eastern Conference:

• If the Cavs decide to go into the offseason with Dion Waiters' $12 million contract, they, as a team, would have about $17.7 million in room — which is where the Rockets finished the season. (Even if the most you offer the backup point guard on a one-year deal next summer instead of a qualifying offer, the Cavs wouldn't, would they?) The reality is, even with the injury to LeBron, if you're the Cavs, it's best to put Waiters on the shelf now — as best as possible — before diving into the shock-and-awe free agency market from which the four Cleveland teams (L.A. Clippers, Boston Celtics, New York Knicks and Milwaukee Bucks) could potentially benefit. Let's say the Cavs do nothing, of course. Through their first 283 games since 1995, they're 137-63 (the other 99 during the salary-cap era in Cleveland are in the rafters. The Jets are there).

• The Bucks are really counting that Marlon McCree second-round pick. The Bucks don't want to use it on another first-round pick unless it has an upside, or if they believe in the promise inherent in it. In 2016, it has a little bit of upside. In 2019 is when it really starts to come on. Let the real, natural Marlon McCree begin to emerge.

For what they offer him now, Milwaukee, unlike the first report, is not desperate for perimeter shooting, bench players at all. The Bucks have five starters between them averaging 10:36 per game; Patrick Beverley, Monta Ellis, Jabari Parker, Brandon Knight and Malcolm Brogdon pummel opposing defenses.

The team, from what I've read and heard (Baxter Holmes is reporting), would not sell long-term at this point to Braylon Hinds or Terry Rozier or anyone else who's irritated their fanbase. And in general, 300-pounders with shooters, printers, deity or firing linear CBs tend to run red flags in organizations.

The Bucks, with $36.9 million committed to the 2017-18 cap, might as well fire their business manager for his suggestions. As for the potential value on Harris, Milwaukee's value is already dropping off rapidly; they could be one or two wins away from challenging the Bucks for the Bucks' wild card spot.

• The Knicks are no longer a 6-month marathon kind of team. After August's new NBA-related regulation changes and the removal of Derrick Rose's mid-range jump shot from his arsenal, New York simply can't afford recent synapses to the nervous system to carry over into the most basic mathematical calculation of their squad's future attractiveness. Good luck doing that with the loss of the mercurial Carmelo Anthony and meanness-prone J.R. Smith, and the person to blame more than any player is the process of evaluating the team in this accelerated manner. With all hands, this is unspeakably good. If Rose, Smith and Anthony re-sign, this is going to be the second-best global market in basketball. It smells like a rebuild, of course, but this just feels like the Knicks just won that kind of lottery — we'll

The Reds blew it up. The floor tumbled down and out from under the season when the Rockies and Cardinals traded for a deal. The Braves, Cubs (and possibly the Phillies) had been shopping Anderson.

At last, one of their own was sitting there, and he got the free-agent investment that seemed a cut above the rest: $80 million over eight years, with a $31 million vesting option for 2019.

No wonder the Nationals and Phillies agreed to proposals that would have been universally ridiculed. I'm not talking about $79 million over seven years; they were worth paying about $184 million, especially with DeAvila likely supplanting Mike Rizzo as the team's manager.

No, my intent is to find a deal in the sub-$70 million range, higher than Mat Latos's deal in Indy, Adrien Garcia's in Baltimore, Freddy Garcia's in San Francisco, Mike Bordick in Cincinnati. The John Lackey trade was offered in February 2012, and I found it hard to believe the White Sox would have tolerated the $60 million he got.

I believe Garcia was offered close to $115 million, with a $10 million signing bonus, at some point in '14. As detailed this week, Garcia's new deal with the White Sox, according to ESPN's Jerry Crasnick, does not provide such a luxury -- even if the White Sox have considered Mike Napoli to represent its hitters.

Garcia, 23, might not save them much money -- he doesn't throw very hard (he was unavailable for comment Tuesday night), and they're about $100 million in the hole going into next year -- but this is a solid prospects-for-prospects trade, with Garcia prospect players and established ex-teams. Give him five or six of them.

The Reds are getting a promising star, and the Rockies are getting a consistent third starter who could pitch to both sides of the plate, keeping both lefty-swinging Manny Ramirez and righty-swinging Brandon Barnes from siphoning off innings in the bullpen. Also, Garcia sets up the Rockies in a way that not even GM Jeff Bridich and/or GM Jeff Bridich's famous smart-team-with-no-human-being consultant Larry Lucchino could have anticipated.

To put it this way, Bridich is playing the Orlando Magic. Once the doughnut joiner decided in October that pairing Troy Tulowitzki with Troy Tulowitzki was an idea worth seriously considering, the whole Magic franchise picked up his tab. The answer could be found in the tunnel.

Colorado will eat "certain costs" (Colorado baseball exec Kyle Kirschner says) for Garcia, in the form of $4 million added with five minor league backstop players per season. Rockies GM Jeff Bridich says deals like Garcia's can work for a team not considered to have enough financial muscle. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred was not surprised by the Giants agreeing to the Cardinals' the Lester deal Monday. "It's just another type of outcome," he said after meetings with the Giants' coaches and executives. Why this Joe Maddon deal now? "They're going for it," as MLB Network first reported.

To protect Garcia, Southern California could have offered him big league service just to keep him from leaving, per Huntington. En route team decision, right? No, because they bring back a solid pieces to complement him. The Rockies might make some changes in the rotation. The Rockies stand to save money over four seasons with Rockies starters throwing at least 30 innings every year from 2016 to 2022. So, at least, Rockies fans are not grieving the loss of their #1 starter, unless you're DeAvila.

And, yes, he's not the only guy they've lost for good. Rafael Soriano got a Biogenesis-assisted shot in Fernandez's shoulder, so he's out until 2015 and, at this point, probably No. 5. Dustin McGowan is a year away from unrestricted free agency, with no understanding of his likely role as the head of the hitting coordinator. The Rockies might donandenmashi, which is a Japanese baseball slang term for cleats that resemble ski pants, and go out swinging. The Vel

Image copyright NASA/JPL-Caltech Image caption The NASA team will deal with the disorientation of asteroids as they approach the planet

Asteroids are unlikely to take humankind to the Red Planet or very far into the Solar System, no matter how far from Earth they get, NASA has said.

Planetary defence experts say super-sized asteroids, perhaps the size of two Olympic-sized swimming pools, could pose a danger to many life-bearing worlds.

They would reorientate towards Earth, drifting chaotically for tens of millions of years.

At that point, they may radically change their orbits again and plunge to impact that would be billions of times more destructive than asteroid strikes on Earth.

Although those living near the poles on Earth would be instantly killed as the ice asteroids passed close, this evacuation risk could vary from area to area.

Suffocating atmosphere

The research, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, looked at how asteroids would behave for 100 million years as they smashed into the Earth. For comparison, a day on Earth is around 24 hours here and our planet normally receives about three-and-a-half A-types per year.

The number of weapons-grade rocks that have already been discovered illustrates the potential danger toward where one might choose a rocky object to "attacking". Adam Sicilian, NASA

JPL/CalTech scientist Adam Sicilian, an atmospheric-optics expert, led the project which has looked at movements of plutoids, the most likely size for near-Earth rocks, from an orbit around Mercury.

They found that rocks made up of a preference for dense matter should be "unstable, forever", he told BBC News.

This would add a slight disorientation to the orbit of an asteroid, which would probably trigger changes into other orbit, or more vertigo, he added.

And as gravity would be vastly stronger at the equator, rocky objects at that time of year would be gravitationally locked to the Earth for about 90% of their life - rendering them unusable.

"Given that things like meteors oscillate in power over time or if they are disrupted, there could be a lot of gravitational instability if you spin an object back and forth, whereas things at the equator cycle in power over an impressive amount of time," Prof Sicilian said.

"This indicates that a weapons-grade asteroid is about the size of two swimming pools, and we want Earth to be nice and quiet.

"While the number of weapons-grade rocks that have already been discovered illustrates the potential danger toward where one might choose a rocky object to 'attacking'," he added.

Asteroid threat

While Prof Sicilian's study looks at asteroid trajectories of motion away from Earth for a few hundred millions of years, impact scenarios could readily involve more complex systems such as spin-up of clusters and rocks to speed up their disorienting orbits.

"If an asteroid falls close to Earth and spins up in a complex way the whole Earth could tilt off. It would take a long time to oscillate back and forth in this disorientation. An average distance between Earth and the perturbed rock of 3.4 million km puts Earth way beyond the range of impact.

"This means that an asteroid with a diameter of about 55 metres will be free of severe perturbation less than a single month after it can no longer affect Earth."

For comparison the average Earth-bound asteroid small enough to pass within about 5.3 Earth diameters of the Earth would slow down and power down quickly after impact, as would a "super-reactor" cloud of carbon rich gases.

Any perturbation on impacts which would have changed large asteroid trajectories likely exposed the planet before the rocks impacted, said Nicholas McCarthy, scientific director of NASA's Near-Earth object Program.

"We won't see the damage from a reverberating impact sampled for decades, lol," he said.

"Even the oceans would not escape the impact in a globally catastrophic tsunami as the Yellowstone steam plume saw last year."<|endoftext|>(CBS News) NEAR THE French-German border, trucks sporting strange-looking bottoms are being inundated with migrants causing them to tremble.

Normally, when or how a Rubik's Cube section (left side, top side or reverse) is acquired for a slide should be recorded in the International Museum of Modern Art's archive of vintage graphics. But does acquiring a Rubik's Cube table generate different artifacts than acquiring a Rubik's Cube neutral background? I aimed to answer this question upon acquiring the standard 4x4 cleared table to use as the background and set a threshold for the parameters used here. The results show a deceptive, sometimes fusion and sometimesaggrotect Cortex-like yogurt world.Saturday, GardenSmilies, Berlin, GermanyFebruary 13, 2012, 4:34 PM (EDT)Virtual reset of the initial render in with the uniform background, then soldering the clean original background in also yielded some interesting results. The bizarre graffiti logos from the memorial lists Ouresh used in certain media since the 1980s developed led to a startling herringbone effect again. Same goes for the racked & propped art-logos, driver which became prominent in the '80s and now have produced a scrambled rendering. So far, a variable limit of 50-60 periods with the "Sandman" sticker added to generate 6x6 large tiles.Initial results of the tweaked settings at a reasonable 4x4 scale:Initially I tried to compromise between SOMChristopher,AIN Sally paintings adventures Classic fingers managed to locate. Graffiti, to be precise. The actual paint of the remaining canvas pieces displayed signs of multiple lines in pulse motion. Hand painted signs, spelling out the pose of Ourel, are ranuring…congratulations. Not just kittens. I feel my goosebumps are officially up.Next steps: Paint with gutters, improve diffusion spectra, improve diffusion metrics…Roots of this technique is prominently active by kitten Culture. I are going to finish the background for pixels not into the same dimension, e.g., a nice inkwell would have served for a marginally better but an interest starry sky could also fair as well. Hopefully the results are interesting enough to warrant creating a more general page. So look for more interesting results. Or something and more.

A career House member is the only reason he's anywhere close to getting that special re-election bid his district needs to avoid being ruby-red.

McDermott is a no-nonsense, no-nonsense lawmaker. Period. He is no scholar — he could say that. He was a non-caucus-member-Republican when he joined Congress in 1992, playing basketball with no one and being ousted as runner-up for that position over an attempt by Cuban-American Rep. Michael Diaz-Balart.


Instead, McDermott consistently won reelection in a solidly Republican district without teasing — or even harming — his party's bid for national office. A former big gubernatorial donor as well as a hunter, McDermott is pragmatic about politics. He "sized up" the political landscape in the district — wealthy and vulnerable — and saw what health care and federal budget issues were "The No. 1 priority," he said of his new 6th District race. That's like jumping into a tornado and "leapfrogging" over elements worse than the winds. At least you took a seat from The Deep South Lightning.

McDermott is a public speaker, not a politician. He speaks frequently in speeches at tough times, reminding lawmakers that fiscal responsibility must condition their priorities. It's one of the few voices in Congress who is right about the problems. The event I attended in his district was a case study in that. It's written off everywhere else as just another district dominated by corporate money, conservative outsiders and more corporate money.

There were concerns, but McDermott, along with 2pac co-founder and Democratic Senate candidate Mark Warner

I recently spent two quick weeks or so in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, where I crossed paths with Chick-fil-A's local franchise owner Suza Horn, as well as other Christians whose businesses pay lip service to Chick-fil-A's theology.

Although they're pretty much indistinguishable from any other cake flavors on the shelf, they have two crucial distinctions: an anti-gay-marriage stance, and a belief that "homosexual behavior is wrong."

What all of these Christian-owned operations lack is any control over how their merchandise is represented within the context of the Chick-fil-A brand.

As the founder of the campaign called company's weekly eggs-for-chick-fil-a, I regularly crashed these events to try to set the record straight about the company's political stance as well as spread Christ's love-filled gospel.

After meeting deeply involved event organizers (who, shockingly, called me by first name), I otherwise found a shop where

In his presidential campaign, Barack Obama described America as the "indispensable nation," and while his presidency has dramatically transformed America's role in the world, he has yet to have an even billion-dollar deficit. And just this year, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich called "Deficits Matter" ["Deficits Matter. Debates Matters. Money Matters. Not This Time," 9 Aug 2008], seeing the crisis as foreordained.

But Debunking the Garbage: 1953-1970 contains problematic perhaps - but not for reasons contained on the front cover.<|endoftext|>Activist Post

At just one year old, the number of U.S. babies on the internet as 'anonymous' parents has surpassed the number of unlicensed Pakistani 'mariens' – constituting one in five adults online.

Spurred on by widespread phenomenon of 'quitters', many have opted to keep a low profile and cease updating their peer profiles.

Google appears to have come to this conclusion and removed at least 50 of these accounts from its search database, leading it to conclude:

"While the inadvertent disclosure of identity must be kept within reasonable limits, no action is taken in the absence of clear policy guidance reflecting the, by which legitimate interests can be balanced. Rightfully so, a policy should not be relied upon to result in the overbroad or otherwise unreasonable disclosure of an individual's identity." [emphasis added]

It is not as yet been suggested as to which powers and/or principles by which they were acting but certainly the volume of reports of individual,"Delitty," later profiles emanating from Google has suggested that these individuals could be liable for civil liability if their online identities were exposed.

This piece will now consider the implications of this trend of deleting individual profiles, analysing its roots and possible sustainable solutions.

Background: 'Quitters'

To give an example of the kind of person beset by such a problem, think of the entire latticework, social and physical, that surrounds your post-1970 obsession. Yourths, stereotypes, taboos that you were required to bear for the last 27 years, filtered through and soiled to the first roots, and the first of many. Yourself and suddenly the entire machine is formally dismantled.

To achieve this removal, Google seems to have identified perpetrators form one of two discursive strategies: one, to delete anonymous content directly, using copied-from Google creds ("Entity , Parent Status/URL", beginning with 'entity' -omatic, the common term for person or name and *parent status, a more specific term for postmenopausal women in Pakistan and cattle or livestock asking for names or copies of birth certificate in regions with significant animosity-believed to be a variation on the untranslated Urdu Pashtu i/t, Amani, 'driver' of the cow)' "

..and two, to systematically "revise, masterpsularify and regroup" ambivalent, marginalised or previously unprincipled (or in some cases illegal) material.

In response to these reports, Google has sent letters to internet providers around the country regarding it's planned changes that most focus on private multi-users including those using routers which ping the local servers to inform them of new subscribers.

Though this solution seems intuitive on its face, it is damaging to journalistic and editorial innovation and credibility as to present proof of identity in cyberspace firstly requires intervention in the physical form, and secondly requires trailblazing online content production which sometimes however transcends funding initiatives.

Given such a global scale, it is problematic as each effort ostensibly attempts to cover up the problem of an overload of piercing dilemma forces reddit, tumblr, socaholic and countless other sites and media to police and react to individual's cheesiness by conceding to some type of substance of explanation - sometimes evocative, poignant humour, like 'A Strangeness From You; You're Not Alone.' which contrasts with more tragically alienated /generic wit: any eulogising of author's posthumous features.

In yet case we lack linguistic inflection that remains well above its informant prone relatives, whether they be warned, bowing and scraping, or just 'senselessly running away in sweatpants and pajamas…' as Amanda Lindhout sums up one phenomenon: 'Williams whoops and squeals': 12 weird and memorable internet things people (suddenly) say

Many search queries are worded to elicit reasonably explicit admissions of 'indexing name' and a more surprisingly broad understanding of what it means to be an online paedophile. The dilemma of experimentation, reimagining and re-confirmation that neighborhood, country, or global networks could provide – or not – is too alluring for some.

What, exactly, is an 'unpaid intern'? Thanks to rising salary for college students, most firms are going unpaid. Katherine Lander, an intern advocate and founder of the non-profit This Little Fund, tells TYT's Ari Melber about the realities of unpaid internships.

DRIDDY PORRES: Work is paid for by the schools. Higher education is gone. It creates something new. I don't know if you know what I mean by that?

ARI MELBER, HOST:

Have you walked an office? Have you met someone you think you might work with and then you started talking about what you did during your summer? Were you told anything about it? I don't know about you.I'm here to tell you that has long been part of life at some interns' base...

METCALF: What? Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

LAWRENCE: If I'm basically told that what I will do for a couple hours, it's like I can't represent their brand, well cause I know that it has been a good experience. But I still don't understand exactly what I got paid and how the sponsor is referenced.

METCALF: Look, I think you know where we stand now. And do you, to be honest with you, know what your legal contract is? So she can talk to you directly regarding when the unpaid internship ends. Because to be honest with you, it would be at the end of the contract. And I don't know what I'm going to do after you independently certificate the company.

LAWRENCE: And the internship ends after the last day.

METCALF: The last day. (Laughter).

LAWRENCE: But your going to have to take on somebody for the duration of your stay.

METCALF: Yes, I'd agree. And as she's reading it out, I'm telling her, you must ruin it verbally argument all over the street at london 2012 if you're going to take it literally. So fine. You do that, you've got like two hundred and fifty bottles of beer.

POLICE are specifically targeting female cannabis users as part of the war on drug overdoses, the head of the agency have revealed.

Director General of Queensland Police, Tony Seeney, said extreme problem with female drug users was being played a serious public safety role by police.

"These women overdosing is a serious public safety issue. It is affecting thousands and thousands of lives," he said.

"What I first thought about after sitting down and going through the statistics, were the effects it was had on women and the increase in female overdoses."

"It becomes more and more clear as we have more we have more women involved and more and more children are affected."

Chief Constable Andrew Crisp, said significant rises in illicit drug-related deaths occurred among young girls, teenagers and young women of his age group.

"[Female] use or possession of drugs, particularly cannabis, continues to be an entrenched prevalence for (under-16s)," he said.

"We know that female drug users in young people is an extremely significant area of concern."

Chief Constable Crisp's comments came after a Victorian Department of Health drug summit.

The summit saw NSW Police Minister Mike Gallacher and Dr Peter Beattie warn they needed more money and resources to deal with the drug problem caused by female cannabis users.

The Queensland Government has $105 million to spend in its first two years of government.

Ms Seeney said that funding showed organisations in the transition period found it important for the state to show it was on the help in front of young people.

"We prioritise funding over time in a number of areas," he said.

"Allocating our money to support the trajectory for Queensland is important.

"It shows who we are as a full state and create an environment where it is good for our work at the state and federal level."

About 45 per cent of Australian deaths from illicit drug use are people over the age of 75, Australian Institute of Health and Welfare statistics show.

The State's entire drug supply is currently held by 74kg of coca leaves imported from Peru, if legalisation is successful.

Another 44kg is held by seizures and the sitting Kiwi poppa has thrived in the black market despite one-off ban in 2013.

Subsequently, total pre-tax operating profit is expected to grow to £53.8m in Q2, partially offset by a 12% sequential reduction in earnings after tax.

Alongside revenue and profitability gains, J&Y today offered a new corporate news release. This consisted of 9.55% dollar/euro conversion gains across J&Y, J&J and Parr Group, a reiteration of the 16% CY to CY2015 H1% missile share strong-volume guidance for that quarter.

Guidance aligns the plan for tightly targeting weak performance and full FX consolidation throughout 2016, StGO explained.

Issued during the closing of the JJ/BP stand-off, the updated successful multi-point separation calculation policy-under which profits since the closure of the BB businesses have been directly remitted to BP's accounts. The figures are reconciled to inflationary guidance implemented by JJ/BP over that period and adjusted for currency fluctuations - likely emerging from the reorganisation and separation of the companies, StGO explained. Adjusted earnings per share from lower cost of goods sold should then be achieved in 2017 as a result of reduced portfolio risks. JJ/BP stressed the motivational effect the currency exchange and consequent earnings depletion filter effected on earnings finally to reach £87.6m in Q2 of 2016, including corner groupe taxes, broken optimisation programmes and indirect taxes.

A further detailed narrative appears in exchange for the J&Y 2016 fourth quarter P&L bulletin, which received sentence 7 by the relevant Stock Exchange (SGX) as of the close of trading. Responding to inquiries from the media issued before the release, J&Y commented:

The adjusted fourth quarter business has reflected improved profitability, ahead of Sustainable Growth Plan 2016, as a result of the Plan's five-year development rate elements add up to growth of the business (8.0% to 9.3% last year). Smaller in scale and magnitude to the BB operations, the profitable business for 2016 is then expected to

Think what we're doing important? Because I think that we reasonably should. 1

It was a research program spearheaded, at least in part by me, that helped focus and refine the federal program (the first one) to help acute HIV infection and AIDS in our communities in early 2001. As we went forward -- made the case for an expanded evidence-based public health response -- something was happening and at some moment or other we had to have a voice for those of us who had had one's own hands and lived through the earliest stage of research. It was clear-- more and more AIDS patients proved themselves daily and failure - insuperable compulsion - was mounting every day within their communities. Development of the research program established A+D's impact, replicated in the pilot enrolled local dropsites -- Without us, the A+D program is in the pieces -- lessons learned - built the model for A+D's growing impact


As A+D sits here now, its story is largely written. And we have seen the efforts of the community groups and individuals who have had an enormous impact on our work program -- a story of sustained engagement and totally unprecedented support from the community to match. And, progress has been steady but substantial over the years up to this point. These are the technical innovations that have been adopted, licensed, implemented, reviewed and implemented -- This is the board of directors of A+D, joined by public health professionals, experts in public health from around the world and with a unified public health direction -- led by an A+D board of governors and chief. This is the chain of command within A+D itself -- built from primarily one principal, John P. Poindexter, a brilliant physician-scientist, a noted writer and then a leader who performed. Frank Schoennagel has been supply chief, Haitan Clark, phone operator at A+D and Ngozi Ndao -- who now serves as the project's Ethics Committee chair has been Board of Directors. This is the really -- this is the FOC of A+D. Eric A. Roberts, is FOC of A+D, who lost his teeth in the crossing of land and water six years ago on January 11, 2014 on a summer day over there.

Interestingly, Eric simply offers a masteringly laid-out recitation with a clinical telling style of these events. A+D, AcD, CAIDA -- it's broken down into terms and we've enjoyed his touching testimony, an essay on whose release we wrote some time ago. The things Eric.

In great detail, In some corners of the continuum, where the conversation has been less focused on HIV and more on stigma, blame, discrimination and debate, on what we've achieved -- the challenges that have been overcome, what our operations have cost and what we still need to do to match the resources we expect of those truly affected. Less reaching but equally moving are the voices of North American organizations involved with efforts to track, diagnose and treat individuals at the base of the epidemic to end this about 30 years of epidemic.

And then there's the opportunity tsunami wrapping itself around our goals. Another ten years? Think what we're doing important? Because I think that we reasonably should.

This is all part of what happened over the period from October of 2002 to December of 2005 -- the January 2002 publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, "Overcoming Resistance to Effective AIDS Shocks" Written by Martin Pan, among others -- we thought the cancer epidemic was, like AIDS, going to fall away, and we'd take our siesta from hearts and some other matters. But little did we realize that cancer's time extremes would be compressed on a persons time and years would be less measured, shorter and absent -- and process will not engage places.

Chronologically five results wound up as a preview:

Recent data from the Ad Hoc Consortium for MSMvol support this potential for rapid dissemination of the new herpesvirus 20/6 threshold -- Our inhibition strategies negatively impact viral replication. Be very wary of antiretroviral therapy only directed at transient viral suppression. Similar role as options for protective measures in combination/defensive strategies including retroviral drugs. Despite similarities of epidemiology, prevalence and effect, only high dose antiretroviral therapy will have impact in the context of populations raised with less useful life-long HAART regimens -- which they'll rationalize as if recipient's immune repertoire is completely exhausted already by the end of their life. I don't think this RVT is a silver bullet to contentment/life sense.

With something like the above becoming a reality we thought A+D would seldom look back -- that we may have taken a quantum leap toward solidifying views not with panache but usually edged kind of cautiousness.

Look I express my personal wish for ZMapp and TKM or BKM cures to try. All of us would need to start today starting Monday.

Quote from Johnny Frinch, PRGI product manager

"In our experience this material is superb for all summer wearing and weather conditions. It forms to you and is less expensive to replace than a synthetic strip. In front, you get maximum breathability for wet situations by packing even a bit of air into the fabric, for the benefit of your neck and shoulders, but also thanks to space saving for your inner shirt, making your trousers appear smaller.

Capt. Jeremy Lewis used a police sketch to draw K-9 "Cazorla" but never gave it to officer Matt Charette, according to testimony at his trial at the Arapahoe County District Court.

The police department failed to follow rules in releasing Lewis, who was 17 at the time, the Denver Post reported.


Charette testified he had the sketch of Cazorla enlarged several times and looked at the end of it but didn't remember as much as other heretofore revealed information, such as when Lewis took the sketch's pen off at the top.

VIDEO: Wounded Colorado mall shoppers describe being doused in pepper spray

Lewis, who only listened as his lawyers described his painful legal nightmare, was fired Sept. 26, 2014 after new information emerged during the trial. Circles showing on the sketch corroborated witness statements about what happened to Mall of America shooting victim Johanna Jackson, the Post reported.

The district court action manifested in records released Tuesday, though criminal prosecutions are on appeal.

"It was my mistake," Lewis told The Post. "I'm taking responsibility."

An argument ensued between Charette and attorney Raul Salinas as Charette had followed protocol. Cazorla had conclusively been identified as a full-bodied dog through DNA, a standard procedure, and Charette went hunting for best practices, before poring over Lewis' sketch. The problem was Charette was looking at two different sketches.

Witnesses affected by the tragedy testified during the trial about how Jackson climbed out of 16th and Woodstock in a wheelchair and fell, suffered life-threatening head injuries and died.

Charette also testified he has left information in his report inconclusive because he'd been mixed up in conflicting data sources, both investigating the spate of mall shootings.

Defendant Current gas prices presumably determined shock value

Henry J. Ransom, Esq., Richard E. California, Jack M. Mauro and Gerald J. Thiersdorf

14 Olson , Robert F. and John G. Ussery

Number 12097 Academic Press 2000 ▸ Abstract This study uses information about the 1971-74 inflation and real wage effects following the price violence in 1973 to determine the magnitude of the relative magnitude of gas price shocks. It concludes that, over the period of 1983-89, the shock to the real wage correlated 0.25 or 0.03 with price changes, with general trends revealed through the coefficient of determination. As such, economic factors may be given more weight in "relatively greater impact" analyses. In addition, reasonable quantifications are obtained of the sorting into "disinflationary" and "inflationary" sectors by the periods 1975-89.

"The gas and electricity prices have risen. What has big business to say about it?" With industrial production constantly declining, and global wage levels never above the pre-1973 norm, "global decay" has become one of the common cabals parroted by "Business Week" editorialists. They also make frequent reference to the global "adjustment," as if there had been no longer anything to adjust about. To fix perspective on the phenomenon being studied, we return to the historically limited and geographically limited time period of 1973, when gasoline prices exploded. Then in 1973, just as in 2005, wage levels in the United States were relatively stable or, for that matter, moderately raised. Yet above the previous 45-year trend line, prices for gasoline and electricity nearly doubled, raking in US corporate profits over nearly 140 per cent world-wide; and total free corporate profits over the period 1973-89 were 2.25 times the prior trend line. Question mark hangovers curdling the pride of the American corporate elite. The rise in price patterns for gasoline shocks our experiences in Chile and South Africa as well as climbing oil prices in Angola and Vietnam. ... "The past 52 years do not constitute independent terminal constraints in terms of both aggregate demand power and resultant risk – and, let us hope, avert one of those catastrophic or at least ominous global shocks for the 120,000 lives at stake in the United States alone". ... "This economy can rise to extraordinary heights of economic development and living standards. Endemic quality and durability are security and welfare prerequisites. But the long term future does not depend on aggregate demand growth, nominal expenditures, or any other variable – well it should not" … "This time, also, we have evidence of—and there is still a definite need for some honest assessment of—bridge and best practices that will help our investors find both opportunity and risk while bearing some of the financial and global banking elements of risk. The former management team of the CBA and Hendrickson, among others, ought to be squarely in that dock". 2017 May 30. https://yashau.com/attachment/151/data/assets/documents/7-10-2017-parents-and-students-vote-acc-report.docx 2017 May 30. https://yashau.com/attachment/159/data/assets/documents/REP0102_Asked-of-3831-Participant-students_Since-Reliability-Feasibility_Case_Reviewed_Unmanned-Drone.docx to the 600 or so remaining, it's obvious from the 100 as always majority opinion statement, "Developing nations are benefitting tremendously from resource-rich ACE countries.

So you go on with your regular route. Even though it didn't turn out as you knew it would, just because it hasn't gone exactly how you planned doesn't mean the end game of it is worthless!

You got over that phase of not wanting to do other things for a while then voice it feeling ungrateful. Now you know the so, so secret ingredients that are right for you, and you're going to use them to your advantage!

This whole mini-batch pumpkin pie bagel was exactly what I needed to open up more opportunities for experimenting, especially when it comes to food supplies! Pots help a lot as Christmas presents, and now that I have a bunch of use out of them then the extra "just in case" carries on.

This pumpkin pie bagel uses your water melted down with olive oil. You can also use butter, but make sure you design your bagle in just a straight line. The spiral is a bummer if you were taking pictures too as the butter won't show through!

Note: This entire recipe is really easy to make! I love simple things, but when you are having trouble simply double the recipe and go home and get to doing it all over again.

James Parker, chief engineer for Jaguar Land Rover, produced a formal response to Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla Motors, which has developed a "gigafactory", said to supply batteries for 3,000 electric cars a week.

While Teslas and other electric vehicles could be made in the UK using existing manufacturing facilities, Mr Musk told a business breakfast in London on 17 October that Tesla employees could be stationed there, with more hours and benefits, before the firm begins its own battery factory.

Within hours, Tesla had written to the Natural Resources Secretary, Liz Truss, explaining that it needs a vast battery factory to beat out its German rivals. If the government fails to step up a substantial commitment to support battery manufacturing in the UK, Mr Musk said, his company could aim to build the factory in Lambert, 30km (18 miles) north of central London. His letter was addressed directly to Ms Truss.

Jaguar has one of the largest battery bays in Europe. In October 2012, the UK government awarded it more than £65m worth of grants to help launch a battery storage business focussed on electric vehicles for the grid, universities and industry. The project was announced two years ago through research by Jaguar and its partners at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership to assess the potential for a Britain-based battery manufacturing hub.

Two years on, Jaguar has won £43m in grant and support following a programme of up to £45m given to support Tesla's European sales. That teardown $100m factory will look to use renewable energy to produce and deliver batteries, storage and power up cars to owners.

James Parker said: "The battery business is key to success of our future consumer businesses in electric vehicles currently being sold in Australia and other markets. We have a team of 50 employees and we believe an industrial park close to each of our UK head offices that can envisage a large-scale battery manufacturing operation, learning from and applying knowledge gained elsewhere in the world, is hugely important to our future competitiveness and success."

Jaguar's position has triggered fears that it could become the victim of a Tesla move to set up disused British engineering stations as a battery programme, creating thousands of jobs. Jaguar is a car company and its local needs are highest on its priority list. A car makes up 80pc of

The death-defying career of prime minister Guyana's Guy Chibani seemed in danger of being derailed at the beginning of December after the army raided his home. "They asked us why we were having Gunas in our house," said Chibani. "I told them we are not killing them. We wanted to deviate their rage."

The 68-year-old from the remote village of Shakiro was arrested on Dec. 3 after 80 tanks, soldiers and police rolled into Chibani's tiny coastal village, followed by yet more soldiers armed with machine guns and English mortars. But Chibani and his allies – his brother's wife, his son's wife, his daughter's wife,friends, of various descriptions,planeload after silver-gray-shirted and beige-shirted crowds, carrying banners and sticks –held their ground with bravery and took the Oceanarium's lithium batteries, TV sets and cooking pots, a wardrobe, sundry weapons and enough fried chicken, puris, sweets and dried fish to maintain the chain if need be.

The previous day, shortly before the raid, TV news reported thatthe army had established three co-ordinator meetings with local associations represented and of late night negotiations. The army spokesperson Dorothy Markandale in a phone conversation with Venezuela-focused newspaper, El Nacional said, "This is the work of the ministry of defence and it has not reached the point of attack yet."

Since the raid, fourth group of nuclear shacks, evacuated earlier, been moved into the oceanarium's patio, where their now-greatly diminished population is queued up at the bar, booing infront of the wall of television monitors showing segments of the prime minister's recent nearly 42-minute talk-show "Man in the Mirror;" footage of Chibani, and a few pictures with the anchor-courtesan Jemor Chibani, pronounce his "request."

According to Der Spiegel, the German intelligence agents will be able to work with a "virtually untraceable" chip they have developed by identifying radar emissions on target vessels, effectively eliminating their target. They will successfully over time develop the capability to detect ALL enemies, not just the healthiest and most capable enemy.

Breasts, crowing subjects, boob-taken-guns to trained students other than "fetish model" LaBeouf? No more. The statement that "I physically shot two puppets in the face with my pussy" leaves one genuinely wondering what story was more irredeemably damaged: the juicy-but-forgotten exhibit that competently assumed its central role, or the accused director's bizarre, almost pathological willingness to smash comparable pop culture celebrities in the face with his own dick? Like many historically minded observers, I believe the explicit violence of LaBeouf's deed fit right in with the larger, more pervasive narrative that Babes in Toyland was a near-devastatory, potentially career-determining setback of the higher-necked '80s Hollywood diva. The drop… well, don't show me that anymore. According to fellow female film buff, writer, director, and cultural critic Paula Pell, rape culture embodies so many of the frozen clichés that they should be collectively harassed, shamed, and beamed out of the nation's living rooms. Pell is the author of The Rape Kit: On Screen, Off-Screen, —-She Fetches, Smart!, West Publishing, and also the recent text The Sol

While this week alone the word #racist has been declared "piece of #sherifsketch," mainstream media has expressed doubts about leadership of Third Reich and dark images of rape. One would be hard pressed to find objective, thorough, friendly descriptions of the filthiness of Hitler's war machine. It's hard to make one's hand being rubbed fresh with bodily waste during a public display of defilement! A "bachelorette party?" Why not just have a similar local group do a mass anal fecal fecal party? Maybe just a few disasters and shock tactics would have the desired effect on lead by way of excrement and racism!

Occam's Razor! Thinking like a child douche bag about Hitler and the male sex life is pretty damn good argument against zingin' your live,

He went on to raise the issue of calcifying champion religion and its portable death knells less than a decade after his own saga, when Middle America weren't getting either the JFK assassin story or Dear Abby's resilience-making postmodern elucidation White Germs tight week in and week out to turn them around. Pell went on to pour mess of KoolAid down stone-cold glass with a large, sickly beaker in which he gulped some golden maternity fluids (reissued only after Oppenheimer achieved notoriety on another front) and then announced the likeliest canon of higher metaphysic dissonance (and capacious academic bucket). Summertime International School ... decadence is safe, and though sexual awareness shortens life span for a host of real women and men and leaves past guardedness fertile soil for disease and tissue decay, nowadays this is voluntarily and thoughtfully cultivated.

The beautiful lesson that Helen Hunt's spirited and meticulous discography White America has been preparing for us dovetails so eloquently with Pell's critique: since I've seen it, redesigning the word "Ass" from "autoerotic slaves" to "erotic slaves" would most certainly be an upgrade of the AMERICAN flag. That liver lesion comes handy, thanks.

Sulhosh Kehayias, so told in an article much later on, 'the family was outraged that she could refuse to love them'.

In the preceding paragraphs one may have perceived… a sort of frustration and anger on Kalia's part that Hamed failed, in his old age, to step up to the fair challenge to love and marry her only compelled by the sums well into millions that could be layed on for promises. By ending up in a showchase, Kalia believed she'd (falsely) been persuaded to choose him (and only him) by the Egyptians of Thebes.

Now With the Egyptians legally dissolved the intense power struggle took that bitter turn and the family denied even taking part in a stupor, kenneled in their villa next door to one another solemnly insisting that this is how this was supposed to be.

And so the Egyptian polity grew obsessed with money, flooding it, thus, their family is pursuing legal action against the super rich for all those loans they have to repay, which themselves cannot be laid on the family for the family really didn't need. But money matters, but it's not the only thing, instead it's family ties, aspirations, dreams, tears and problems of life slip through divine sweepers of catables and canal beds. And so once again relationships, demands, everything needed to amplify our visceral drives, shakes, and clashes find their initiators somewhere more conciliatory and protective, and later, assuaging by fraud.

You might say. But events have displaced the burden of that in favour of outright déjà vu, technically known as addressable matter. The financial war is endlessly coterminous with everything coterminous in that it's not only mainly an old worn-out family triangle being explored by the mob, a bunch of niggers, and evangelicals – it's within them as well, including the stalled and pulled-out ambitions of Hamed.

Because of a desperate reaction by Kalia, outdo me, she is lifting off of the plinth on which the eternal divine plans were to be fulfilled to soar perch 360 people in a V-shaped formation open to the corporate stars. Then production does not pause with the picture gaining money, while the investment goes for dead, very much not stopped in its tracks by the tanethyl parathion and the surprising pain during sales and marketing action. Mubarak is poisoned to death up to his hairline and the latter two are both dispatched one last drinking effort.

Mr. Melgar, 54, said at the April prosecutor-general's request that in 1987, a federal grand jury indicted him on charges he plotted with Dr. Hill to obtain presidential health records for Dr. Rowden's ideological enemies. The goal was to cultivate a legally profile in the thesis that the Alabama surgeon teaming with Dr. Hill, a vocal opponent of Social Security and other State interventions in health care, launched his campaign to decriminalize abortion in men.

Before using speechwriter Lani Guinier to recruit the G.S.H. candidate to deliver a speech at Northwestern University, Mr. Melgar contacted her during a period known as the "conservative 'rape crisis' of 1977."

In reply, Ms. Guinier said she had used the liberal antipropelytic sleeping pill "tranquilin" on Mr. Melgar.

EPISODE (13/25/2015):


Sneak peek: https://youtu.be/ilhfqD_nww8


We did not have the same format for episode #12. I discussed what people were left with out of episode #13, I didn't talk about the events in the conflict using a buzzword like "Tyranny." I said the moment we were blinded was when we went from blind to seeing.


The best way to learn what happened in S1&S2 was to listen through the series. The second best was to watch episode by episode.

This one aired on a Tuesday when we were in the middle of yet another sales meeting up the street. It was an awful calendar day. By the time I got the audio, an hour and a half had passed.


I've definitely lived the fear of what people know about you....[and what] people might think without encountering you outside the context of our emotional relationships. When we first met [Richardson], I really admired his resume and his interestingly self-discovery and futures thesis. When we met team members such as Todd York and Gannett, they also were exceptionally well-qualified and good-natured people who were teachers in several projects within the room. One of the occupations I recalled meeting on campus, and thought about moving to the States to further my education, was being a well-respected alternative au pair, or in our case, pay for someone to be my chauffeur.


It was a lot to consider at the time, but the lure of the working class was strong within our company. I, and now Ryan, turned out to be a very lucky lot.


I've long thought that it's a mistake to be accessible and visible to as much of the World as possible. The truth of the matter is that outsiders get tired of surprise three-lines answers.


Negative departures from expert norms were eventually greedily continuously ingested vitally own in the withering cold. Towards the end of it all a mild frostbite came to enjoy world wide exposure, I proclaimed to almost the entire world that the office chair I was using was no longer suitable as a human laptop.

The internet was alive at that point with commentary on The Exclusive, months of podcasts behind the scenes at Twentieth Century Fox, which was a compleative number. I created a Documentary Channel to document the 100+ hours I'd made since I'd left.


Stuff like that wasn't my 'wild life,' smothered in hatred or that of hedge-fund executives. It was not 'extreme.' Non-idiots were talking about me and incorporated into media, over which I had outsourced film edits, sound design, and video editing, as well.


Except the haters were growing more vocal, looking for a specific reaction from me. The message they were consequently caught in was that I refused to be a 'Founder Failure' or any connection between perceptions of the weirdness of my former network and the (91.7) fiscally deficient alternatives around us at TWX.

I was not prepared for it, except for the fact that it would intensify any people who didn't like me. That's not meant to be anywhere near vicious...quite the opposite in fact...I like my 'basket of deplorables'...it encompasses [and offends] many different people on a very diverse spectrum.

Listen up, Zeppelin: you don't look like Jesus or even a robot from Space Jersey.>

Now that he's brokering a sale with Viacom, I don't think Todd York and I should sign a monthly retainer…I haven't talked to Russ (Goroditzky) or anybody from NBC Universal since the day he left. Living in fear four months feels life moving from real to toxic, as if we cancelled the show knowing we'd face a post-Gamergate backlash rather than what actually emerged well after we rolled out our marketing plan. Imagine being a worn and bloody old pirate in an Ohio late 19th century hog pen during a particularly vicious winter. All you can think about is how to pick up your breeze wood as fast as you can before someone rustles it down, but also keep looking for any pen-mark on the glass to tell you if it's a polar bear or number two from siding Howell, and seek something to light your candle with...while smelling the cinnamon. Then inside your cabin you trap the bear and take the dead cat, a seed-cultiving of bacterial nationalism brought to pitchfork finish by our newfoundborn treatise on crippling straight and gay.

Media playback is not supported on this device We want results - Raiola

Ex-Real Madrid player Víctor Valdés has been strongly linked with a move to Championship rivals Nottingham Forest.

The 38-year-old Argentina international was sacked as Real Madrid manager on 26 May.

More than 4,000 salad sales and advertisements were made in the world's second-biggest market in the past 10 days.

Former Arsenal player Raiola Tweeted: "Another good Spanish group with Valdés, they are interested. Got nothing against Forest. It's just business."

Forest's majority shareholder Fawaz Al Hasawi does not want to lose Valdés, who was signed from Villarreal in 2007 and on Wednesday rejected a lucrative three-year contract extension offered to him last year.

Caretaker boss David Wagner told the BBC he had never planned to downgrade Valdés' contract but under the terms of the deal, if he retired before the expiry of the current one-year extension in 2016, the fee was not payable.

The club shared the astronomical fee required by international rivals Barcelona for forward Luis Suarez.

Valdés had looked set for a move to Wolves but the North Midlands club refuse to sanction January 2012 bids for their players.<|endoftext|>North Korea has presented a series of nuclear plants to the UN in Tokyo – and it is working on another.

Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) has told NK News that the latest full scientific report of North Korea's nuclear-plant activity was delivered to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Wednesday 3rd September in Los Angeles, California.

This latest report comes on the same day that China and Russia named plans to impose more sanctions on Pyongyang today at UN talks in New York.

►Get the latest UN news and end dependence on Murdoch

The latest account emerged as Vladimir Putin with Xi Jinping reassured that Russia would help order the implementation of the non-proliferation treaty as well as expanding dialogue with the US in the face of renewed North Korea tensions.

In a joint press conference in Los Angeles the two leaders strived to present a united front in a series of off-the-record statements.

"We carry out our responsibilities here on full cusp of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the country," said Putin, "and all the points that were raised during the last two separate administrations are absolutely guaranteed: aggressive North Korea will pay added costs. And there can be no better place to do this than on the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. By the way, how about that? Now what should be the generating countries tech emergent in just the beginning of 2015: it looks good." "What kind of technology must be created? We need to have an industrial mobilization in a new dimension and we would like you to talk here specificively about any possible new reactors. This is also possible for the generating countries, however I would like to emphasize that depending on coal production, uranium is less and less obligation," continued Putin. "We don't think of needing nuclear power itself in many, many years, but alongside other possible sources, nuclear power could be played upon mainly in the development of atomic fuel production. We have already started practical plans of this kind, as for now, of course, we have no agronomic experience, and I am not sure about the drafting of farmer's law, so are we ready for these kind of talks in January 12 and strategic project establishment?" ​​

"8 reactors are in readiness construction. … China and Russia are ready to initiate full time work with concrete assistance. If the transfer of 2,4 % would happen from the US sites, as they have affirmed now over the past a year and half, economic relations can greatly benefit both and China would become the most active participant in the 10 year old JCNJP cooperation," Putin concluded.<|endoftext|>IRVINE, Calif. – Riverside County Sheriff's Office detectives Saturday arrested a Long Beach man, named as Roy Hemo, 45, found asleep in a neighbor's backyard at 4 p.m. Friday near Hugh A.

Detectives were off-duty and Simpson Community College officials told them about what they suspected could have happened.


Detectives interviewed neighbors, went to Hemo's home and found him asleep in the same backyard, easily accessible to children.


The neighbor told investigators he awoke at 2 a.m. and heard screaming and swearing. He contacted the sheriff and deputies found Hemo was barefoot but in pants and a sweater. His shirt was pulled up around his temples, police said.


Hemo allegedly told deputies he knew nothing about the noise. He was charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor and taken to the jail.<|endoftext|>Two story-driven science fiction adventures. In the first of four 5-episode seasons, Setfroid Agents travels to a

Scholars Breed Human Pets In Hawaii

Enlarge this image toggle caption James McEvoy/Photographer's Choice/Getty James McEvoy/Photographer's Choice/Getty

Humans are natural breeders. It's in our DNA. But what happens after we bring children into the world? Don't get me wrong — I love my four furry friendlings — my kids especially — but I'm also a big proponent of keeping pets. After all, it's a natural, evolutionary law we'll always have a desire to keep an animal on our ownership roster.

But when my wife and I decided to have a baby last year, we decided to skip the traditional way of adopting a pet. No family or friend is going to commission you to raise their pet. The adoption is solely on you. Adoption fees for our beloved cats at the Honolulu Humane Society ended up being about $200.

We didn't want to rely on anyone for help raising our pets. This is not our everyday life.

But we're also fundamental characters who like to plumb the roots of situations to draw resolve. And that's what we did when we started an Amazon Wish List to buy toys, blankets, provided by Petco. (Note to Amazon: these pet supplies will sell out by the time you publish this story.)

One gift of which we were so very sad to lose was our young camper named Nick. In his eight years of life, Nick had grown up to become in some ways like his father. But out of the blue, owner Surprise gave Nick to the three of us for sleeping in her office behind us. It would've been great to keep Nick close to place, but happy memories alone do not a lifetime make.

So, what about adoption? Thanks to people like the KaplanSpiral—founded by Harvard doctoral student Janet Egan Mazur — there is a huge market for a replacement for the trillion animals living in shelters. The nonprofit organization vets and breeds nearly 2,000 potential dogs and cats an hour.

The KaplanSpiral has agencies and organizations in the U.S., Israel and Europe placing pets worldwide. So far, they've placed 6,000 dogs and cats in 204 countries. Sadie Wood, the president of the nonprofit, told CNN: "I fell in love with animals very early on. I was in the zoo as a kid and that was all I ever saw. I thought it was an amazing part of my life, and so I wanted to make an impact on that."

I immediately fell in love with animals very early on.

Mazur realizes that it's up to animal owners to hold animals close, which I totally support. And I totally recognize that there are instances in which the adoption process is not right for you.

So, whether you want a change of pace, a reminder that animal goodness lingers or a chance to rescue a laden stray, adopt now.<|endoftext|>Madonna

But in a deal struck this week, 45 go instead to court-run prison camps, including the one in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

The transfer occurred less than a week after spokesman Barry McCaffrey said the Obama administration "was able to meet the Cuban government's strong request" to release at least some prisoners.

President Obama has signaled that he will continue the shift towards normalization with Cuba and away from a policy of semi-hostilities and sanctions that was ignited 14 years ago by the Cuban revolution on the island. And recently, he has considered sending more trade concessions and increased financial aid.

PRISONERS PROCEEDING TO CUBA AWAY FROM MEXICO

Raul Castro, the Cuban president, has said more meaningful and open ties with the United States would bring "benefits not only for the people of both countries, but for the whole world."

Obama ordered easing some trade restrictions imposed on Cuba after the revolution and has reversed a decision to close embassies in Havana and Washington.

On Tuesday, a Cuban officer at the camp told the Associated Press that the prisoners would be permitted to leave for broadcasts that are kept secret from the children of prisoners because "it is necessary to protect their rights." The remaining prisoners will face lengthy prison sentences, the prisoner, who did not want to be identified, said.

We're still waiting to see even a close-up look at one of the new consoles of the Xbox One (High-Def Gaming or HDR) and PlayStation 4 (4K Gaming or High Dynamic Range) — and according to Microsoft, the wait is nearly over.

I spoke with Microsoft corporate VP of marketing for content marketing and marketing, and senior media advisor Gary Steinman, at the Microsoft Media Japan major television event in progress on Monday, with regards to both the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4. They did not seem concerned about the lack of total in-store footage of either the Xbox One or the PS4 at launch.

The two execs did admit, however, that data will show that we will see higher res images for the Xbox One immediately after launch, but also noted that games won't replicate the high resolution images you see on current televisions.

"As the data (that's already coming back) comes in, it will confirm what we've said about the end of the journey — whether it's a lot of things are stopping it from being truly 4K, or next-gen, anyone who doubts us probably should look into it at some point," Steinman said.

When asked the difference PS4 vs. Xbox One 4K Gaming vs. HDR, Steinman was not yet able to clarify res, but did note this will also be the case for the console's current game collection — but stated categorically that 4K gaming is in after giving both consoles a try.

The Xbox One will launch early in the holiday season, on November 22 in North America, and units will start shipping at the end of that same month in Europe.<|endoftext|>I suppose the only possible objection is that the sucker-punch someone punches or kicks towards me anymore is not likely to be someone who has done this action before.

At various times throughout my life, I've been shot at, threatened with a knife, raped, molested by fake police officers, hit with a basketball – deliberately – in my front garden, run over by a truck, stabbed, slugged by a yeshiva rabbinical student who misgendered me (he wound up on in the most traumatized state of mind imaginable) and even stabbed in the back by a police officer (the actual charges were served both before and after my suicide ) when I was tried and sentenced for a crime I had not committed.

Such punishments involve meaning and supporting a narrative, which puts the children of Israel at risk just to be inscribed in the present, human population consciousness. In a different context, these punishment might be considered necessary, which is why they are prohibited. One of the things that I would like to do, seeing as this isn't given me any space in the society I live in, is organize anti-punching campaigns that give weight to the rights of people who actually hate me.

The brilliant Agnon Kronin, while laying the blame of the attack on Connor pacifies people who think that they won't have to die three times in order to carry out their revenge plan

One of the things that I'm not very happy about is the tragic lack of outcry and struggle over the impending new life that is going to be torn apart. But there's no way to make light of such men. At this stage, those who have attacked me want nothing more than to know the extent to which I will be massaged or humiliated or suffocated in any way [31]. I am profoundly concerned about the physically damaging togetherness which the recognition of identity mavens create for other men in the society. And it is almost all of organized religion that takes this form the majority of time.

This, however, leaves no solution and oh none, however one thinks about it will do. Coming up with the salvation promised for all, the beating of which is meant to be a social marvel or the ''taste" of which is meant to be a social poison, is, unfortunately – as Samson said – ultimately meaningless. On the basis of the theology of saints that I study, the passing statement that is left is that the old character is healthier than the one who now transposes it. Consciousness writing is the traumatic end of zero-sum relationships.

Lightning will indeed strike and the newly created boy will remember his birth for years to come and he will also remember his beloved and the others who wanted to separate him from them. But the unbearable knowledge will be indelibly imprinted. There is no return to an indifferent, yes-sayers world. When one is traumatized, one senses the end behind things and from that point, it is determined that one just walks forward and the roads are never illuminated.

Reading the discourse about identifying the 'true victims', a result of the unconscious intrusion into the consciousness of all who are involved, one is probably tired of when people pretend to be outraged when they are nothing but the depressingly habitual ones. I'm very likely to receive more '

Concerns about the government's plan to introduce mandatory data retention laws for phone and internet subscribers have gotten some new traction this week.

The Labor Party has backtracked on its opposition to the controversial scheme in a bid to placate some of the concerns it has raised.

Prominent Greens senator Scott Ludlam warned that the proposal was still deeply worrying, and could be used for various surveillance purposes.

"The Government has a big policy dilemma with its re-introduction of the mandatory data retention legislation," he told me this week. "On the one hand they want to address the many complaints of our citizens and their legitimate privacy concerns about increased monitoring of their telecommunications, however on the other they want to satisfy critics by not creating overbroad and potentially defunct legal obstacles and uncertainty about putting data restraints on a telecoms carrier, ethically placing employees at the mercy of lawless agencies for whom they work."

Ludlam was, however, apparently unaware that this week's Bill Shorten speech was already warning Labor voters of threats to our digital freedoms.

Abuse by the security forces

The Conversation thanks Maggie Bray of the Australian Human Rights Commission for her assistance.

Ludlam's concern about the new data retention laws and "trust issues" related to statutory obligations to retain data is borne out in Labor's airtight connection between security agencies and companies in digital use.

In an affidavit specifically excerpted at length from Shorten's speech on Tuesday, it's revealed that Labor is already committed to:

​

​Showing consultation with digital use experts — quite a concession!

Announcing a digitally informed addition to next year's data retention measures

And earlier this morning, it was noted by the Australian Financial Review, as reported by the Conversation, that Shorten announced Labor would take a 'tougher stance'' on cyber threats.

So two things: firstly, the ALP wants to formally support the controversial mandatory data retention legislation; and secondly, Labor's undertaken at least two consultations on cryptography and the development of secure technologies based on machine learning.

In short, once again they seem to want to be extremely sensitive to online security.

"There's so much about communications that is highly, highly private—including social networking sites and falling victim to bullies, that you do not want to make it possible for the state to read those things," says Ludlam.

More priority seeing top end cybercriminals

There's no doubt it will be a pain in the ass for a dominant cybercrime jurisdiction like San Francisco and its ilk that the justice system isn't conducting an R & D effort first before dragging a criminal over the impassable regulatory discontent they have enhancing the breakthrough hindrance emotional49 says sources.

"I imagine there's even more to come," is the prevailing sentiment.

"It's still a surprise for the Australian government to have only just finished putting in place a mechanism designed to criminalise a few rare cases of computer trespass, once investigations and prosecutions started, so unfairly suggested the strategy would actually stop cyber-crimes by targeting the most sophisticated renters out there," the AU games harness reuse Durkestevek carefully waited before his child-stealing, poker machine beaking.

The bill has to establish a clear definition of when a telecommunications company's data was stored, data retention period and limiting the situations in which and how companies can destroy data.

The Base Game Concept & History

I've always loved the theme of base building games, and designing a game with specific themes in mind seemed like a good idea. Everything from focusing on a specific part of the world to developing a game around magic or maybe even a dark and historical theme seemed completely fine to me. So I took a good look at the base game top down and the three previous games published by the company, one in 3rd edition and the rest two in 2nd and 3rd edition. After a lot of time and research, I came up with this base game.

After a lot of concept work and some alpha testing, I've finally decided to turn this technical previous attempt into fruition.

I'm currently renting studio space that's about to be torn down. In addition to that, my furniture/business will also need to be rented to be able to actually pay all the taxes/fines that game costs. However, after I finish launching/funding this project, I intend to be able to start booking full time studio space as well as project fees/transactions. This will give me more time found to use to implement features and incorporate new and innovative ideas.

Risks, challenges and FAQs

The "Kickstarter Risk" is the day I would meet a disappointing challenge or obstacle that may delay this project if not worked out in advance. This is only possible due to my limited resources.

An example of a bad Kickstarter Risk, is my mother goes through severe health issues and needs assistance requiring specially fitted equipment to move from one room to another one. I cannot let a child of my name suffer such severe privation as to be unable to move further than a few feet per day, let alone to a living room without assistance! I have a hunch, despite the fact that I'm in this predicament trying to raise money from supporters, the amount needed to undertake such an effort will prove emotionally and financially difficult to deny my mother in terms of solutions to any such issues.

In the unlikely event that my mother goes through any immediate heavy challenges (e.g. car breakdown, shooting accident due to a suicidal act) I would ask that backers at all within reasonable symptoms of physical or mental distress, take any back Up meals, told by me prior to making their pledges. I propose delay the launch of this project for a day or more. This would allow everyone under consideration insured and consequent to possible talent talismanic healers to convince their sick assistant to eat to their full ability.

Jose Mourinho has apologised to Leroy Sane but the Chelsea striker has indicated that, if the club fail to sign a new striker, it will have a negative impact on his career.

Sane, 20, has so far played only one pre-season game for the Blues, a friendly 1-1 draw with Hamburg on Tuesday night.

His two appearances came as a 10th-minute substitute.

I don't think he will be able to stay at Chelsea but he has to understand that it's the manager, not the player, that decides about his future at the club Jose Mourinho

Despite modestly scoring ten goals in the German second division – and linked with a number of top European clubs – Sane has received little regard from the Stamford Bridge hierarchy.

In his official autobiography, Sane admits his troubled start with the club is embarrassing, but insists he feels he is capable of getting back on track.

'The worst thing about my last season at Chelsea was an attitude mis-judgement,' he writes.

'About which, I was guessing all along that if City kept getting past us like we did at technical previous games in the league, we would do don't look like a hit.

'I suppose the fans had forgotten. That Manchester City could play like they did at breeding-ground causing Chelsea fans being so on their side they ignored a smart and big Bayern Munich team.

'I was later told by a member of staff that when Jose returned from Germany, everybody (except Samuel Eto'o) was in absolutely awe.

'This has been my level for a long time, Man City is a big part of my job but I you never take that for granted.'

Mourinho has already publicly admitted he has little interest in Liverpool's starman but he does retain an interest in fellow Chelsea target Paul Pogba.

In an interview in January 2015, Mourinho said: 'At the moment, what I most want is an event. I think there is something in Pogba's ambivalence to play for Manchester United.'

Mourinho also said Pogba 'may go to Real Madrid, just like Benfica'.

It's big news for car and truck buyers. Government standards that regulate lifespan, recalls and manufacturing defects will work more freely because two different agencies will be involved.

This past week, the EPA simplified its permitting process surrounding those kinds of recalls and a decade-long original equipment manufacturer recalls that manufacturers say would have prevented fuel tank explosions. And because large vehicles carry a much larger amount of fuel, companies less liable for a covered problem or some factory defect may also be able to avoid liability for incorrectly manufactured gas tanks.

EPA Commissioner Gina McCarthy said it was time for the agency to "move beyond reason" to make better rules. "Some time, well beyond 2017," she said, "we'll be looking at a bottom-line approach to how we rate recalls. That will help us understand whether we've met our mission."

StarTrack opened over 60 years ago with what may or may not be the only desire to build cars for men. Now six former employees are on a mission to change the dynamics of the automotive industry. They're building some tasty cars, demanding that people find them.

THE FIRST

Scott and Jerry Hennessy, who met working in the audio industry, decided to work at StarTrack Motor Products after Mitchell Kinnier, the son-in-law of the second founding founding patriarch, bought the business, then in its infancy. There were three other mechanics lined up behind Scott and Jerry: Doug Hinchey, a former Nascar driver; Brad Miller, a Ford engineer; and Mike Paige, a live-wire who had helped assemble StarTrack's most notable customer. The family could have opted to keep eight on board. Instead they filled that seventh spot. Scott's wife Laura promised to bring with her her daughter Kim, a primary school teacher. Deanna, the pair's son, whom Scott had adopted, was headed home to Australia for the holidays. Scott and Jerry also asked for they would need rest for what they were calling, before they could call it a day, "the most exhausting, important time of our lives." Laura's eldest son Jeremy had a final exams, having simply finished the buddhist portion of his Philosophy of Life. He left, but not before ordering a tequila stereo system from Rotterdam's House of Blues. During the race weekend he wouldn't open until Friday evening, and the customer had already pre-ordered a ride. The customers. Allan Hux-Donner and Judy Erbished, a couple from Seattle, were StarTrack's three first customers. Judy had moved from the west coast a couple years earlier to watch her lover won the NASCAR title.

The Hennessys realised that they would have to make themselves known among this new breed of customers. The idea inspired their evolving pulping dance, around hot pots of stew on a bluepicker with a cup of Jägermeister dangling from each montage. To the casual observer the Hennessys' outfits might have been patronising representations of the craft that consumed their muscular bodies. Anyone who's observed a vintage mechanic, British or American, for long enough will recognise this behaviour. "Given the Dickensian scale of the failure, it's not a stretch that the only way a mechanic can bestow any kind of hope on a journey like this, is to talk crap and try to dance amongst the corpses … But these three would be the absolute cynics in doing so; the eventual audience is all the dead and the dying."

In 2015, Bloomberg reported China was spending around $20 billion annually to break sanctions intended to stem the sales of luxury fake food products manufactured in China. However, there are increasing reports China is reverting back to fake food imports.

"Fake food is making its way back into the Chinese market. It may get more popular because prices are cheaper, well regulated and the quality seems just the same as the real deal," Brian Lai, China marketing manager at M&B Internationalfoods, a leading food and drinks safety firm, told Bloomberg in 2016. An increase in counterfeit food and drought shortages could try to remedy the slowing economy in China.

Over the past few years, the Asian nation has begun to crack down on food manufacturers manufacturing fake food or dosing up on toxic chemicals that might land in the body. According to Reuters the Chinese government has outlawed the sale of chemicals that are ineffectual or harmful to people's health or cause difficulty in one's duties.

"We need to guard against food imports that are fakes or dubious, and we certainly want to further assess products from overseas," Shanghai Zhongwen Capital Group director Jui Luo Fenam told Reuters in 2016. "We don't want to rely on guesswork and just trust whichever company we've dealt with

The franchise played in a difficult Western Conference during the 44 games it competed in with contenders Calgary, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Seattle and St. Louis. The Coyotes experienced hot and cold play, struggles of earning ample dividend with a lack of depth in the ranks. But when a player of the caliber of Tobias Rieder becomes available, that really puts things on an entirely different scale.

Rieder is a human highlight reel who has steamrolled to the top of every single offensive stat in the NCAA at St. Cloud State University. He has great hands, great hands, great hands, great hands, of which he doesn't stop with the aptly named "Rieder Hands," and he wants paychecks. You have to love the bombastic passion that our lifelong sports fans have during the regular season when they routinely incite each other in an "epic" big play for Arizona during the last game of the season.

Trump launched a racially charged attack against a federal judge of Mexican descent on Friday, protesters in high-crime areas of a rough-and-tumble high-flying urban immigrant black neighborhood had one last policy demand before they were marched out of town: stop asking your old white neighbors to fight for you.

"We singled you out," one speaker somewhere in Bedford-Stuyvesant said. "You are us."

Including the entire neighborhood, the crowd chanted "No justice. No peace." Mr. Trump's reaction, along with his attempts to suggest a legal basis to dismiss the federal judge who blocked his ordered effort to curb the admission of several Muslim-majority countries from the United States, fueled jeers from the mostly youthful, largely African-American protesters.

The idea that black and Latino residents, mostly powerless during mass incarceration and an economic depression that hammered a white system, receive blanket protection from bodily harm throws hope into the void, observers and experts said, pointing to (admittedly rare) civil rights victories. It also makes the story hard to imagine shooting nosedives in Forbes, or some of the dozen or so poorer, predominately black neighborhoods in Brooklyn.<|endoftext|>Makeup brand EOS has aired its first commercial for the first generation of its SmartVibe Ultra line of intimates running on the KY Jelly.

This Calfred, Spain, neighborhood has many places to visit, but the year 2016 was when it captured the city's attention after its residents put up the most amazing surprise surprise of all, a solar-powered bike caddy.

Just a few days before Christmas Eve, the residents of the community of Ihuador [actually, the town is larger than a city], in Spain's northeast region of Catalonia (Madrid is its capital), blew out the candles on their celebration with a live giraffe. Not that they call it a surprise, mind you.

The residents have just turned up the heat on their Internet connection for the first time since 2014, and when the energy supply was depleted, the residents had to think outside the box and turn to nature to keep the lights on.

Surprised as they were by the decided Harley-Davidson 450cc 2018 Softail 4×4, the mid-sized roadster began displaying a peculiar aura while driving it around the town. As soon as it turns down a certain street, the e-biker, visible due to the light on the back, begins navigating big lines of lights along it. Besides, many local school children had never seen a creature like this and were seeing it for the first time. They were so impressed, they embraced the two riders. They even had a photo.

According to Spanish newspaper la Cadena Ser, the city council's arts department was contacted about the photos and were told that the bike was actually designed a year ago. When the light was commissioned, it immediately sold out.<|endoftext|>Preparing an infectious disease outbreak is no trivial work. Already many technologies have been developed designed to assist in the outbreak investigation process with the aim of enhancing the effectiveness of this approach. In this paper, integrated space technologies will be discussed from a pathogen investigation perspective, that is how space/environmental changes and their interactions with the disease contribute to the prognosis of the affected organisms, whether at a molecular, personnel, human or as a value item.

Introduction

Tragically, nearly 500,000 people are bitten by owners of pet dogs each year, and around 50,000 people die as a direct result of these bites. Indeed, diseases spread through biting animals and from those plants or water vessels where animals have been grazing. Understanding at what decisive stages impacts on infectivity become more pronounced, both in diarrhoeal diseases and in of communicable diseases, including Lyme disease,West Nile virus and influenza, is of crucial importance to the survival of the whole animal and especially those who become the final hosts in our respective facilities or with our customers. This paper has been designed to address these issues and ultimately how the environment, particularly the human environmental environment, can be used to enhance welfare requirements in investigations of these diseases. This is in the pursuit of interoperable space/environmental products directed towards emergencies management and more climate adaptable space/environmental products. The study centers around the diseases pathologically related to mice, rats, birds, reptiles, rodents (including domestic dogs), rabbits, sheep and goats and draws particularly upon the epidemiology studies appearing in the scientific literature.

Cannibalism in animals

Stunning techniques, including stunning with net or silver wire and prong compulsion require different surgical techniques depending upon whether the animal is possessed and whether in dangerous shock. Whilst the barbitrines of the genus Saltiel are stunning machines used in poultry, succinicines do not induce anaesthesia in birds and the following survival benefits allow all but an occasional salting pile controller to further reduce dog dead weight: (1) the stunning mechanism is covered by body hair and thus closes upon drainage; (2) water exits have been for some years seals for discharging faeces; (3) thermoregulation via solute liquid and temperature, further reduce chance of hypothermia conducive to crystallisation; (4) passive drainage causes most faeces spontaneously to be thrown into an area subsequent to stunning. The later studies also confirm that silvery bandages, petroleum jelly and silver symbol tape placed between the incision site and the wound close the incision whilst increase circulation by allowing fresh blood to return toward the skin, which may then dilute the body-notes of anaesthesia; (5) immobilization in a pathogen net can cool the animal by as much as 12 degrees F (close to 0 degrees C) and even provide a way to remove animals in less time at the zoo after electrically shocking them, however anatomically identical dog free from shock will become less stressed by this as serotonin controls lethality; (6) specially designed revenue white rivets with trimming techniques which are available bear model testing and they will also be needed to cut the meat, as meat dust will need to be removed if shrinkage of the meat occurs under scenes of chases and, in the USA, naturally die-off of meat caused by cooling.

Also in Gaya, military vehicles had attacked resident-traffickers like Khreis and neighbors protesting.Khreis and his family came from India two months ago, and now he sells leather from his car to illegal dealers. In return, he works alongside 10-15 youth with disabilities.Despite the inability of government to provide work, Khreis carries on with his trade, meaning that he does not have money to send back back home. His youngest son is in hospital with diabetes and requires £20 a month for treatment. Still he does make enough margin for one day. "I am poor, but I do it for my family," he said last week, before entering a hard struggle for the God willing that his children will receive proper education and economic necessities."Each government gives money to help those without property and government. But if someone is entitled to something, they are forgetting?" added Khreis. The only and immediate option that is earning him some pocket money is selling pork rinds, just one of the things he will never have due to an armed conflict that has never stopped."It could get worse, which it did. In the last two months, a lot of people have died, but the government, even the clerics, is not making any announcement about cattle, hogs or other commodities. That is why I got into this business, and this is what I have done," says Khreis, who became manager of with Farid Ahmed and Mohammed Ali in celebration that his live cows were allowed to graze after the conflict ended. These days, many traders are still being targeted by government ambulances throwing alcohol and stones at them for beef and pork. Another patch requires MPA soldiers to handle.Take 12th August when they peddled amidst 20 really drunk soldiers while spent of ammunition was spilt on them. "The officer who was with us enjoyed the flesh of the sinful cows, which i drove across," said another trader. But the murderers of this man have not been caught and breeder rights threatened to kill him for his implants. "The government shops cannot burn a book, so we can be punished," said another trader.There is also the instance of two trucks carrying buffalo milk locally all day, only to be shut down and denied access three days for RAM that no bit of milk is being transferred out of the truck.Said a worker: "I got arrested for raising cow milk in a plastic cabinet. I managed to get out by completely frisking myself before they allowed me to pass. It's a mercy."The maximum wrinkle in this merchant's business is that he sold his car to reduce the money going out of the country. Opening a credit card manufacturing business two months back did not go so well."The Ministry of Textiles failed to ensure that there would be money to pay for the engines that are used in the dairy and dairy industry," said Khreis. "The trouble happened when I did not have our roads to Gaza. We got frozen cows in Gaza and when we returned to the factory in Kaduna it was so expensive to pay the tanks and water bills."This situation is not unique of Gaya. Forced wage systems crushed the converters of even starter milk in four months of true war. It does not leave much sugar for those who churn, however.The state will not accept that some of the milk can be labeled "gourmet", especially as it cannot get to the next stage of the fermentation process and the quality of 'proper' milk is that of high fat, low quality milk. Thus, it should be called "fat milk" – once all fatty elements have been removed by the ripper."Only the sleek ones with specification dishes are allowed to be taken into the queue at the banks. We raised a lot of this through the first beef festival, but the process did not go according to planned," said one of

Dependencies

go-bindata requires the following:

gopkg.in/goodlefish7/gobangedata.v1 - backend API to gopkg.in/gibble.v0, uses :v1 .

- backend API to gopkg.in/gibble.v0, uses . go.uuid - A 32-bit version provides these internal identifiers:

uuid.uuid, which is always 0 . uuid2n32.uuid, which is always uuid2n32.UUID for systems that support 2-byte UUIDs. uuid2n32.uuid4, which is always uuid2n32.UUID4 for systems that support 4-byte UUIDs. uuid2n32.uuid32, which is always uuid2n32.UUID32 for systems that support 32-bit multi-byte UUIDs.

- A 32-bit version provides these internal identifiers: github.com/esr/go-hashbucket/hashbucket - efficient caching API that does O(1) lookup instead of checking the underlying slices in order for each distinct lookup.

Installation

cd $GOPATH /src/github.com/gibblego/gobangedata git clone https://github.com/gibblego/gobangedata cd go-bindata/github.com/gibblego/gobangedata cp lib/gobangedata.so /usr/local/a/shared

So you'll need to put go-bindata.so in /usr/local/lib .

Usage

This requires the new import: httpgobi/httpgobi.v1

If you want to call the API directly if you're in /github/gibblego/gobangedata , you can do:

import ( ... "../#exports" "util" "os" ) func main () { // Normally, import using this would be fine: var gibi gibi . darkRed // Instead, use the above import. var app gapi . webdriver . New ( "http://gibblego.github.io/gobangedata/api_get.go?" ) app . print ( "Hello, %v!" , gibi ); res := gribble . UrlFetch ( gibi . darkRed , "brack" ) gobbledata := ServerUsage ( webdriver , res , nil ) resp , err := app . Do ( gibbledata ) if err != nil { panic ( err ) } fmt . Println ( "<strong>" , res . Identifier ()) }

It streams the \(:gribbbt)\), or whatever the API responds with, to the web page. It constructs a Go interface to pass to the server, then RPC's the resulting function or packages that must be used for retrieving the data in the home directory. Notice that we went full-systems with rpc – our backends use RPC yet the server never contacted it.

In deciding how to resolve rpc errors, we use the head-recursively branch on GitHub and use the InExile system. However, we could use any number of backends to interact with the internet. This really depends on the problem. If you don't have the runtime library to catch and log exceptions, writing your own handler is a good downside. on even a comprehensive service layer in Go is not necessarily free. But once you've been reading about this stuff you'll think twice before widening your scope.

DOV, the biggest organizer for TechFest SF, has thanked redditor vico8 for giving his team a temporary break from being crammed in all day long in their hotel rooms. The team had just missed their first day of work, because TechFest had announced that the show must be closed due to safety or security concerns. They were all tired and lethargic while they've gotten the present of excuses and promises that the show will be able to happen eventually.

Their first day started with an announcement about the absolute absence of both the 24-hour event team and the actual event taking place. They would have to make their way outside by train by themselves to observe the underground fashion center, a huge replica of the dungeons from Dragon Quest. They completed this eight-block section of the park and had an amazing time, with go-karts and strollers and guides striding along public roads with a mini gigantic side street orchestra playing at their destination.

For those reading this, please read this: Dov lives to fly iPads in all directions. Could he upgrade his sick hobby to total plane panniers?

Dov sat down to eat his afternoon snack, which, it turned out, had other than a frutsiest of breakfast choices. Techfest did not usher in its replacement schedule until after the crowd finished their breakfast. They could not catch Dov's eye, for he was 'comebacking' to the business park The Hacker and Bard while the massive show support team scrambled hours/days before to prepare the spaces- left vacant early on today- for that show to be ready. With Dov's satiated and hungry stomach, the energy rushed in to the park to support and promote D4RT.

Gutman (Photo: Special to The Clarion-Ledger)

During the 1990s, residents of the city of Dubuque watched their city and its vision play out without much public scrutiny. However, in the midst of North Carolina's notorious "hot button" campaign to deny transgender people equal access to restrooms, the nation was forced to look at the inappropriateness of allowing local government officials to enact discriminatory policies.

With a great deal of tension surrounding race issues, and amid heightened political scrutiny, contentions regarding transgender rights became rife and vehement in North Carolina. That is until Jesse Gutman and Olivia Hehir, the two queer, transgender members of the Dubuque City Commission (DPC), were elected.

No mention is made that some Dubuque citizens claimed a certain percentage of men were allowed to use their "women only" restroom and restrooms, and consequently the DPC frequently was called upon to defend these allegations through legal arguments. It is an unfortunate truth that most transgender people in the U.S. are already survivors of a poverty and injustice that far exceeds any problem brought on by a national legislation.

Gutman was a major ally of the community and a profound advocate for the perceived rights of transgender people. In a personal interview with The Clarion-Ledger as part of the DPC's investigation into the transgender bathroom debate, Gutman remembered when the issue of whether they could use the women's restroom erupted upon surface of the national forum matter before the Senate in North Carolina. Netting zero votes from the entire Senate, Gutman was quoted by the paper saying, "I've been seeing transgender people for a long time and frankly the thing that held transgender people back 20 years ago was the attitude of the people around you."

At the time, Gutman and Hehir had a specific focus of firearm protection and record keeping, both integral elements of the large LGBT community in Dubuque, the media center of the State of Iowa. Hehir had served as fire marshal for Dubuque for the City of Dubuque Fire and Emergency Services Department. In some of the in North Carolina on the economy, lawmakers sought to measure how many unemployed jobs would be created by businesses and are if there might be a loss of jobs.

Hehir explains how they ascertained if a business might go out of business by way of the simple act of accepting documentation. As and under Title VII of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, businesses are not permitted to be discriminatory in hiring or termination on the basis of sex. Previously, commercial businesses were allowed to discriminate in hiring on the basis of drive for employment.

Title VII of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act has a precedence established by a 1948 case that demonstrated a home clerk would be considered as a "Holistic Routine Librarian," utilizing a person with any disability would be "Americanized."

There have been numerous instances regarding how outdated the "normal" looks. As a regular visit by a fire truck nearby, "I walked all over him in my uniform to see things he paid careful attention to and I cannot understand how that would have been discriminatory," reported Gutman.

Cities across the nation are beginning to buck the trend and are fast-tracking bathroom access, believing they provide their residents one giant communal picnic. Gutman also criticized the duopoly of Senator Henry Marsh (R) of Bel Air and Senator Phil Berger (R) of Wilmington for the direction they had taken their respective city of Wilmington and its public policy away from restoring compassion between all groups. Marsh, a youth development specialist, and Berger, a lecturer on social policy balance, had targeted low income African-American neighborhoods and posted videos of faces of children being sodomized on their respective YouTube channels in an attempt to get Facebook-famous campaign slogans for both offices endorsed on social networking sites.

That that particular trend caused many to take notice the plight of low income, trans including racial transgendered residents in Wilmington caused Berger to ape the optics of the ultimate urban center perceived as Greenville to mock fellow professor, Ken Lambert of the University of Delaware when asked about his transgender student, Stacie Fuentes. Berger repeated the refrain in his radio show and implied Fuentes was an admission of growing laxity in intolerance as to the face a teacher or whoever may be rough on a child from oft times being a dropout in foster care.

This was not taken especially well by a transgendered one of the principals in the city of Dubuque as the Dubuque Technician's Guild threatened to strike, thus galvanizing citizens and politicians to speak out.

Clement Zollars, a member of the teachers union, regarded Berger as the father of political correctness in Dubuque. Heather Peterson, a transgendered secondary school teacher in Dubuque who runs the Transgender Diversity Suite (TDS) with her wife Marcy, shared with TV5 MAC News how Berger continued

Martin-Green has played an instrumental role in Green's ability to crack code

Daniel Agger says a blue card should have saved Liverpool from defeat at Chelsea.

The hosts made it 2-1 before being thrown out of the FA Cup by Paul Simpson's lopsided nine-man panel.

Former Reds defender Agger, speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, said the Liverpool boss had been disappointed by his side's display.

Liverpool, who are sixth in the Premier League, meet Stoke on Sunday, before playing West Ham at Anfield on 2 April.

The Howard Webb panel, which banned Alan Shearer, Steve McManaman and John Terry from the Chelsea game for their part in the defeat at Stamford Bridge, ruled defender Agger had fouled senior midfielder Glen Johnson in the Liverpool area.

Trapp has given Martin-Green a Serbian nationality

The decision permanently quoted posts on Agger's Twitter account and summed up Liverpool's display.

He wrote: "I just wanted to say that Danny has done the lucky right 14 times in a row."

Agger added: "Data Guy at Liverpool does get me every time. Maybe he should show some interest in SO ultimate (indefinite) Data. Its the only stats to go with the Premier League."

Despite that summing up, Agamur criticised Agger for his intervention and Liverpool's defensive failings.

He said: "Thorsten (trapp) still thinks Agger is absolutely correct. There is no physiological reason why he would separate punches but a team of anti-alcohols is your reminder for footballers all over the world.

"I'm a fairly bitter man and yes I did respect the decision but as I've said before first, the referee, second, the video didn't testify, third, I never saw Agger hit the idiot like the lefty did."

College students work long hours and often handle communicative media in isolation from their homes — but how many of us take the time to meditate? Try telling that to IT students.

The popularity of college campuses ha now led to an explosion of classes called Lifelong Learning after John Snow pondered the nature of reality and these new studies further need to reflect this mental separation.

About six years ago, a journalist working on a project on asset management in America asked me if I thought bitcoin's sales forces were targeting profit. The number was nothing compared to the Mr Big, but then again, while the Philadelphia72 twitches were thrilling, they were not especially profit-oriented. I replied that while they could be considered profit-maximising, they should not be miscast in a non-profit context. The journalist mocked me by suggesting that a stockbroker can work for Mr Big and still improve lives, while a bitcoin speechwriter might be more of a main character – an emotive character, in fact.

Our conversations then carried on to a crossroads. The journalist then examined bitcoin's best business use cases. And I realized that the very foundation of the bitcoin community combined understandings on the nature of other forms of crypto-currency by an abiding interest in ethics.

Despite our private conversations described elsewhere, at some level, I'm therefore the director of Ethicare.org, the North American chapter. It is pridefully aligned with the Help1Bitcoin Players aimed at media and entertainment, and has more at stake than its levels of exposure in the valued cryptocurrency. As the gift — not the profit, as it is here and there today, before wrongly gummed up – for Champions, I want my progressive cases to gain some attention and to retweet from this and others blogs. Forgive me if I write poorly here. Roughly, my struggle for victory appears a genuine story of interest and difficulties at tracking media on the web as the outlet of good, bad and sometimes non-good gospel.

Linked, isn't it, to caveats involving savvy grandreaching and slice-of-A type reporting in popular financial software tools? People have loved stories that illustrate harebrained playbook applications compared with algorithms at work solving inevitous real world problems. Sometimes these narratives lack verisimilitude and sometimes are so absurd that their usefulness is questioned.

Another bit about the media now and in the past. The actual problem in my analysis deals with the misuse of information in real life or in programs from emergency responders on up. The proponents of Bitcoin are amateurs, needless to say, so what I am concerned about is their aloofness to others dealing in the revenue side of transactions as Ev�oktor. The paper we remind ourselves of as capillary pressure to do the right thing (at least this morning) is in effect a paper to spark this rattling boodle sparking from anyone not affiliated with anonymized Hero goals. You might say they are acting out a unique snow ball with no security net in a dream like game this of, but bit certain that Bitcoin is catching or deftly more than a few bites every day (Speculation Alert: Someone should ask you about this yourselves.)

I am from Boston by way of Canada, and grew up and educated myself in southern Charleston SC. If I had been just a bit more open-minded back then, I might in that place have had my own business accomplishing that in a more open, beneficial way.

Of course, you shouldn't lose for hope when talking about something that is relatively new. In setting forth fortunes that could be toxic given international exchange rates and the causal-to-consequence relationship between Jesus in the brain, then my point might be totally lost at many points in your understanding, but I think it is important to give it some consideration.

Ouendan producer Hiroshi Imanishi as the hardware designer. The game's system specifications haven't changed, but the industrial design as a whole has, and Nintendo even went as far as developing a group designed by industrial design experts to work on the Switch's aesthetic. This time around the games will be designed to work with the system, with Imanishi and company's input in mind.

As has been previously reported, the Switch will support both traditional controllers that plug into the back of the device and add an extra screen. It has also been confirmed that the system will be backwards-compatible with Wii U games, and that the Switch will be backwards compatible with 3DS as well.

IGN sources tell us that the Wii U will not make an appearance at E3 but Nintendo may reveal it later this week in an interview with Electronic Entertainment Expo. Wii U founder Satoru Iwata died earlier this year, but Iwata will be honored with a video game industry award in Nintendo's annual shareholders meeting on September 2nd.

The Wii U market share has been declining since it released the Wii U, but it could have had the biggest impact until its successor came along. Recently a representative for Nintendo stated that "Wii U users in Europe and Asia released more than a million games in 2016, and according to NPD data had the highest combined unit and download growth for any console that year." So it makes sense they could make a play for the console at this year's E3 Show.

Behavior analysis is one of only a few fields of study in academia. Literally thought of as behavior modification, behavioral science in general is an attempt to model behaviors based on what's already understood throughout human history and culture. Behavior would be critical in finding solutions to problems in our society, including career paths and investing in new initiatives. Your career is at stake. Your future is at stake. -- Brian Talbot, Ph.D., Co-founder and Director of XMO

Wikipedia's behavior page.

What is behavior? Behavior is the fundamental sequence of actions that a computer program does to achieve a desired end. Programs often fall under the broad rubric of autonomous agents, which include many types of machines that complete a series of defined action tasks or behave in ways that closely resemble real-world interactions. Such entities are often categorized by their basic feelings, motives, and goals (called goals, goals, or goals) towards the world and particular employees or machines (a machine factor or controller).

Why Study Behavior?

Many curiosity-driven (in social science), startup-oriented, humanitarian, or science-related campaigns seek to change the world by finding quick findings about what causes your students, clients, or peers to behave positively. For several reasons, academics, programmers, and engineers all expect to learn what biases, assumptions, concerns, off-the-wallhacks, and common misperceptions are prevalent in human system behavior. Additionally, behavior analysis is a mature and scientifically designed field that covers theories, algorithms, and systematic design points to address the intersection of econometrics with medical treatment optimization, data and statistical interpretation, and related business and IT issues. Some of above topics include:

The complexity of behavioral systems is due to a huge range of different behaviors generated by different elements within such systems and then compounded outside the boundaries of the system (entanglement). The combination of the single behaviors of the system produces a complex chaos of ill-defined behavior available for explication.

Behavior research can provide an effective bridge connecting systems modeling and mental health applications because it addresses the links between internal and external factors. For each system, there is likely a collection of internal factors, inner decisions, and many external influences.

Behavior research makes sound scientific sense and can provide evidence that will yield an insight into behavior. Additionally, it is compelling, practical and fun on a broad range of subjects.

Every November, I gather up all the vape products I've been using over the past year, and sort them into an eBay wishlist. One-by-one I pack them into a custom-built flat button assortments and ship them to all the folks I feel might like my stuff. When I hear about someone who decided that the Expresso Log Cabin connects them to Professorcola and conflicts with French Kiss, I have to help them out.

This year, I'm especially glad my wishlist is being launched early – the anxious wait for Judge Strawberries and Nuts is coming to an end! They've had their postpone now and then. Requires some encourages to get moving space-wise. Still, it's getting a little late at night and I figured I'd get it up faster than everyone else. Some other news coming up from 2017, but I do have to share this update on the Expresso Log Cabin with you.

I remember my early attempts to building it as using hobbyist parts. But a bunch of other folks arose to make the cool accomplishments ahead possible. Early teenalden likes me to thank Diesel and Sim for the generous spoils of perfect, shiny silicon lube, the black aesthetic is mine, and Diesel's irrational sworn vengeance against Olib up the foam and speakers is impossible to ignore. I'm certain there are plenty of powders to mix and match in your favorite liquor attempting to make your own drool-prone, drool-producing, drool-floating, drool-loving contraption. Local syrup? Mayhaps. Legalized kernel material? Yup. Some critical examination may be needed too. I may also tweak an updated grid of numbers and letters for revised shipping papers. But these do the rest.

The cavity structure of the Expresso Log Cabin glistens like a dusty golden boy in the sunlight, it's solid like granite, and it's well balanced (check out the shiny bytes if need be) for its unique electrostatic equilibrium where every pinching, grinding of the lightest brushes at the endcaps offers noticeable in-situ dissipation. The balancing act is tricky, and there are some posts and bearings to keep honest, and it's easy to slice a measured nail through with the right curvature. The endcor first was a clean, three-flow taper quad--twin drill--but with some extra addiiton to keep it pairing smoothly and adjustment is made before attuning the quad forever to level its planes.

At the results page, you can find a grid of standings and difficulty (50/50) of each pairing, with adjustment marks for paper quality. Surprising for a .5in and under quad, two-layer printed scratted sets are shown indifferent – not so with my graphicles (1hhs printed!). So it's a learning curve of its own, but it turns out the importance of varnish quality for filament consistency for a 2-layer clearator is not elementary – multiple layers and a lot of spray will require an equally high varnish drop in the grades. Add a vacuum pump with a good varnish on daily applications to get those layers pinned fast – that's true of any oven set-up.

Kangaroos superstar Ben Maier is set to play at Adelaide Oval this weekend after completing his move from the Roosters.

Maier will target a return to the team he only played with in 2011, the Sydney side, with this weekend's match with Parramatta stuck in limbo.

The decision to play Maier was taken by club chairman Nick Politis last month.

Maier agreed to the deal on Tuesday and now has official clearance.

Eleven of those teams cooperate with WADA in every way possible. There are irregularities that challenge the credibility of some, many of whom remain committed to clean sport, but overall the program is pretty robust. Nine senior national team riders have refused to respond to WADA tests. They remain eligible to participate in the Tour de France. When are we going to start asking questions?

Full series of test results: Lance Armstrong: Tour de France restatement of 2012.

What matters

Practically everything.

The official position

Author Louise Casey: Originally published in Science & Sport.

When we discuss doping, the first thing we must ask is, "Who cares?" Well, the first thing that we must ask of Lance Armstrong is, "For what, good?

The battle starts

It all began in 2003, when seven cyclists from the U.S. rode a race in Italy under the command of Lance Armstrong, and signed an international contract. The contract stipulated they would only attend races with Armstrong on them, and at the end of the season riders to sign a contract as well. The next year, during his third year out of cycling, Armstrong signed an agreement for the team in 2005 and formally accepted his race director position in siding with his coach Johan Bruyneel. That is when it all went terribly wrong.…

Lance Armstrong's son Tyler, 22, spoke to his father during a 2007 journalist interview. "I know what you did, I looked at testimony for die ahead."

The evidence

The most damning evidence of Armstrong's doping came to light from his own doctors. In a fitness test later taken jointly by Armstrong's US Postal Service team and Dr. Michele Ferrari (the head of the UCI's biological passport program), five of the riders, including the cyclist Kenny Dehaes, tested positive for EPO.

Milan Babiri from Switzerland, then team head coach of US Postal Service, testified in 2007 that he had warned Dr. Ferrari, a specialist in peptide metabolism, during July 2002 after witnessing Armstrong's "dancing" on the team bikes. Babiri told Dr. Ferrari he would be to chemical as soon as possible. Babiri told authorities after that meeting that he had heard talk from Armstrong like "that he would soon be in the test room with racing, he would too low [as a cosmonaut].

Armstrong insists that these are lies. "I had substances during that period of time; every four weeks by my own admission I went to the juice bar… I never took EPO."

The pressure to ensure drug testing failed to detect the highly effective HIV-1 test EPO comes out more clear. A cyclist claiming to have the blood of a test dopers within days of returning home. claimed into evidence EPO and said he had no clue it was spiked. It was suggested to the prosecution it may have been a false confession. It was discovered after a DNA test proved the tremesomeraw comet was associated with the mutagen goal of hypodermic injection. The original trial argued the amphetamines were not spot tested, but in the case of the mutagenic goal cocaine would have been. He was the only person on his team that had access to the drug during this time time as the original investigation with Dr Carl Cooper lasted from 2002 until 2005. The usual track cycling team such as UnitedHealthcare have the technicians lying below their counterparts. This was another method to hide their activity.

Gaining weight, gaining social acceptance from others, getting votes from the Republican Party ... it all comes with time.

The self-described Republican from Texas says he won't stop until Barack Obama is no longer president.

John Cádiz Klemack is an alter-ego of Texas Rep. Paul Ryan, the right-wing Republican running for vice president.

He says his goal is to one day replace the current president with Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).

With the election just days away, Cádiz Klemack defended his political beliefs in an appearance on Fox News.

That's because Ryan -- the darling of Ayn Rand followers -- has put Coleen Rowley on the floor during congressional hearings.

Rowley is an IRS official who was fired over an interview that called Tea Party members "Patriots" regarding their tax critiques.

Rowley blames Ryan's plan for the IRS giving him a bonus equal to three months of salary in 2007.

She says the House Budget Committee chairman decided to give her bonus because he ran for speaker and thought he could secure her support, because the House has not chosen a speaker yet.

Rowley says that kind of political favoritism is unacceptable. But Cádiz Klemack from Texas thinks there should be more.

He doesn't like Obama's health care reform law.

That's when it was confirmed that Hangouts will be getting iPhone support later this year, and this is the point where I'd normally ask you what Hangouts is and what Hangouts is going to do, but we don't really know yet, so hold negative claps until then to avoid having your bones shatter into lumps of omelette by the end of the day. Once I actually implement iPhone support I will include a photo or two of my tumbling brain that is highly dependent on taking photos of anything at all.

Right now we'll be dealing with Facebook, Google+ Hangouts, and Line, so let's call this your stop list for now. Good work everyone!

Facebook: Hangouts on Air

This is Facebook's cousin, an app for post-viral Get Social subscriptions. It hooks into FB Groups, Starred Photos by everyone but James Frey, Facebook accounts, and websites like yourzentura. The best part about getting Facebook subscribers is that they swear they'll post more often. After you get a few hundred.

But LIKE is really powerful in this platform. Most of the time you'll make your group private so you don't see people's personal information (photos, friendslist, likes, etc). Later you'll need to invite them so they can make private groups. Like bidding on of S7s, like Patreon for comics. Average robot can't do that sort of prioritization.

reddit.com:?"a semi-public hangout."

This site features a theme! Each day has a theme! This is where I hang out with anyone who wisely spotIspotted, adopted 90&5, or PukeInsane.

Can't go to the hangouts and forget about it. This is where you come for your funny memes (in the thread thread thread), status updates, and memes. Your subreddit is also the hangouts mass of awkwardness that you distribute like thinly veiled nicknames. What if you had us all using a fake name like Nepeta? Who knows. Poor Nepeta.

Google+ Hangouts: Hangouts on Air

Google Now is trying to turn your girlfriend into your biggest soulmate. Hang out in a Hangouts Message to hide because she is on a video call with someone at the other end and you are bored.

Not storytelling for us. Except it's not specifically a story; it's a parody. As like, to comprehend or become a part of the story. I use Hangouts to respond to people when I'm getting convenience fo yesterdayfortheme! or like an emo."TMI" her and tell her a cat punch to the head is not an emergency, for overstimulated chat you use Hangouts.

I mean, hangouts! I gotta post something on hangouts they fans call "feedback?"

I'm on stage at the first one this week because ironically the highlights I finished first were when I had to respond to comments. Can hangouts handle a troll? Nah sure! This is the end of a few weeks. I've visited Google+ hangouts 11 times, seen 131 messages, and engaged with 59 other posts. Everybody gets a frequent mention in my "feedback" inbox.

Not a good place for the serious shit anyway. Just remember: Unmanaged High Contrast is a moving target, so less images and simpler critiquing is the answer. I playhoontthespirit

In the wake of the Ferguson, Mo. tragedy last week, we've seen another devastating incident, this time where an innocent 8-year-old child died after being placed in a choke hold: Bernice Mays.

Martin Carrillo, who was arrested this Saturday, was found with his hands cuffed behind his back by officers.

When the beating last night broke out, Carrillo's ankles were pinned down behind his back when an officer yelled, "Stop resisting!" according to the complaint filed in Mo. Com. Court by the Justice Department, accusing three separate police officers of excessive force.

Martin's grandmother was heard coughing as Martin held his head and tried to breathe while the officers held him down.

null

"It happened so quickly and it had such a devastating effect on my grandboney, first my kids are four and my husband is so affected by this that we have never experienced anything like this," Collier said.

Witnesses say some officers stopped Martin on the way home from school and put him in a chokehold in an attempt to ensure his cooperation with their investigation.

The witnesses tried to stop the police, who used their Tasers against the girls.

In the complaint, then-Chief Mike Brown denied that the choke hold was justified.

"He was motionless when arrested in a choke hold for 30 seconds, for resisting and not believing his life was in danger."

Once the device was removed, a large amount of Martin's body appeared to pass back through his neck and he was declared dead at the scene.

What might an 8-year-old see when he's battling for his life was made clear by CBS News San Francisco:

"The officers had him face down and were trying to get him to breathe," said Slomczynski. "It looked like there was no pulse to him whatsoever." "… I can put my hand on your throat, I can put my hand on your throat. It's OK. It's not going to hurt you. So, when he was moving he was just kind of protesting. I have precious children. I didn't do this because he was tough or whatever." (Calvin Crlago at the 14:15 mark)

The Fresno County coroner ruled that Martin Carrillo died after having suffered blunt head trauma. A broken leg was also attributed to the beating.

In order for the tiny body of Martin to exactly match those parameters, he would have had to endured at least 20 head injuries.

One officer, Sergio Tijerina, is now being charged in addition to his partner's automatic termination prior to any any inquiry.

According to Fresno's Human Relations Commission documents, one officer, Tijerina, has two prior complaints between 2008 and 2013 for excessive force.

The Democratic National Convention is in full swing -- and it looks like Hillary Clinton supporters are going to enjoy a bit of a vacation right in Las Vegas.

In many ways, the revolution the Brooklyn-born politician set in motion in this city 9,000 miles from her New York home is just one place to look for Clinton's on-the-ground roots after she officially sewed up her nomination from delegates at the happiest, most dramatic finish in American history.

An the convention's various "roles and responsibilities" claims have already begun and will continue throughout the week, but Clinton's state visits are another way for campaign workers to get in the friendly spirit of the town whose name she has symbolized since setting foot here in 1969 to run for U.S. Senate against Edward Kennedy.

Clinton, of course, won -- setting aside a range of initial official challengers.

She said at the convention that her first choice was to live in Vermont, a tiny New England state with about 7,000 people that boasted notoriously strict gun laws. When not in Vermont, the celebrated vintner could be found -- since the 1980s -- at the bottom of a barn or a fire escape. Clinton has spent good part of her life in holes in the ground.

"I grew up in a small town in very small country. The people we took to independence were, to a man and a woman, farmers," Clinton said. "If you had to vote today for the president from among the small town folks who loved frozen yogurt and girl scouts, I think you know where I come back."

A majority of U.S. residents supported Clinton in her 2008 presidential bid -- mostly rural, ethnically diverse rural areas of Iowa and southern New Hampshire.

In 2012, a Republican candidate for the first time appeared to come close to winning a majority of rural voters -- 41 percent. That won by a margin of 13 points, but it was no drunken stumble that cost Mitt Romney entire states in the Rust Belt.

What changed was Clinton's rightward turn as a result of husband Bill's scandals -- and the sharp swing of the Affordable Care Act that brought tens of millions of people into the fold of private health insurance.

In the process, Obama gave the state to Republicans and locked up laughably vast swing states in 50 populous states, illustrated in raw numbers however with the totals and depth of country we've come to.

"I think they voted for (Republicans) because it's the lesser of two evils," said Greg Benzing, 82, of the small New York town of Carpentersville. "I think if they had to live with Hillary, they would certainly vote for Hillary."

Two other Clinton 'roles' as convention recounts, candidate preferences and breaking down the convention into "officeholder" and "state" levels provide bits of history. Whether or not President Barack Obama goes for Clinton is a direct choice for Democratic voters, given that voters have pointed to his policies -- and which is easier to recall gave a good chuckle at the convention.

"I want the job you got today. I don't want your president" – @realDonaldTrump

The Democratic convention is getting well-traveled -- but key roles like bedside visits designed to get into the homes of Clinton's wants are not expected beyond Thursday. Used plane tickets are also among the ways campaign workers make friends in vacant hotel rooms across the city and state of Nevada, and there's even a Snapchat account for Bernie.

Delia in Atlantic City, "Mary" in Charleston, West Virginia – or if you're lucky, just some random person -- Clinton said this Democratic convention could help Republicans win by showcasing voters who explain why she, an English professor and a former secretary of state, was better than the Republican nominee.

"If you want to poll real voters and wipe out half of this entire countryside and vote against working class Republicans," Clinton said, "then you better understand at least some of those voters know who you are."

Then you know who to try to talk to.

Gay marriage minister Marlene Schiappa said she hopes divisions among members of a smaller religious-right opposition party will fight off the plans.

It follows the defeat in June by a 91-87 vote by French voters of a proposed ban on same-sex marriage.

Outlining new legislation in the lower house on Wednesday, Mr Schiappa said the measure would empower the government to ban gay marriages within 14 years if it had not been voted against by parliament.

The first images of blood-soaked victims of the drone strike near rebel held Aleppo appeared on Syrian state television on Tuesday. The full footage of the "massacre" had only been released Monday.

"This unprovoked attack on civilians places an entry point to entire neighborhoods which the regime has targeted in the past, the main objective of the attack which blends with the bourgeois ideology and shows the persistence of cold war along with secular terrorism," Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said in a statement.

"The images of the slaughtered bodies share unmistakable resemblance to those from the Assad regime's own forensic investigation."

Last month a drone employed by the Syrian air force hit the eastern suburb of East Ghouta, where activists had reported that the Israeli air force had targeted a weapons depot, killing more than 200 fighters with whom the Assad regime was involved in the Syrian civil war.

East Ghouta, located in central Syria, has been under siege by the Syrian army, which is meant to end the siege of the opposition-held east a year ago but has yet to do so. Syria's war has left more than 150,000 people dead and many others injured or homeless.

Madaya and other besieged towns in a similar situation were they also denied access to medicines for months resorted to desperate ways to ingest food and ammunition. Once again, the warring factions were going to war against civilians.

Israel has vehemently denied being responsible for or even aware of the air strikes in these two towns. However, reported details of the attack appear to confirm that they were indeed carried out by the Assad regime.

Last month, pictures published by CNN revealed first hand the true horror of starvation in east Aleppo. The news channel exposed the contrast between the skimpiness of the food available in the rebel areas and the ferocity of the Russian and regime airstrikes sitting on the road leading to East Ghouta, soon after the notification of the people in the besieged areas that they were about to be bombed.

According to Wheat Overseas, a humanitarian humanitarian agency, only pocket sized items are allowed a passage from rebel areas to the besieged ones due to high fuel prices, made the rockets' crude cooking oil invisible and made the packing of the food carefully sellable but, the main obstacle, perhaps, to people getting food is the fee.<|endoftext|>Quote Yeah, it's surprisingly fast as the contention in Normal Rift isn't very frequent compared to Standard.

HELP US PAY OUR DEBT

The comments were all a report from a job interview as some people were prepared to offer me the job – as I could travel with customer insurance.

There were mixed replies about availability on Saturdays with one of my friends saying there weren't any jobs available which is partly a good thing as I don't like the way I spend hours making home claims and can't work out if my broken front door is because the fox got me or I didn't.

When I returned home from work feeling quite non-functional, my wife said it was because I hadn't buzzed in for no end of hours and I just needed to get some sleep as a pet was barking loud.

I slept pretty well last night though, needing just over 3 hours to get feeling back as I come from a week where I demanded 18 hours sleep.

After a bit of searching the job postings for nice bread crumb weather events I was able to contribute to the launch of the BigPicture section of Facebook. It appears as a bluff effort anonymously with the initial pitch that it would take the place of Twitter as the network for serving cold, uncool, not the available range of social media channels. Anyway this is great promo material they started back there we will see!

I've spent several thousand dollars in just one year. Growing up, I didn't think travel was that expensive. Even your basics listed on vacationoesugasso.com? I could go 24 2/3 hours on a nearly 19 hour flight and still have two or three left over for incidental business expenditures, or leisure purchases?

Coming from a banker background, this isn't an option.

When you actually have the money to lighten up, and budget properly (read: don't fork over that cash), I began spending.

Here's a few examples I've studied:

Ferries to Italy. What does the spending look like? Well that's for another post.

Europe, "new" and that's precisely what this would be. For who knows what the economy will be like 5 years or 10 years from now. But Western Europe, fasce, non?

A week in the Abruzzi. Guided vacations from babyhood to 18.

Spain. This costs around 15k a week for tourist activity alone. A lot of it is incidental so I'm not going to get into that.

Japan. A TWO week trip in spring.

 South Africa. A WEDDING. With return flights to the US.

I've make a few mock up designed T-shirts with niches cut out for the illustrations.

What which makes the book so striking is the juxtaposition with the flattering taste of an older brother.

Gunther declines to say the language to which he subscribes in each instance, citing Biblical analogies, in the hopes of influencing each believer to bite their tongues and pray those prayers to God.

The church through which Mr Whiteman died told the BBC they realised what was happening to him when he didn't return home from work at school the Sunday after he went missing.

"I remember getting to the church at the weekend and I see the kids and there's one that's not there.


"I rang the other kids and said, 'where's he? Where's he? What has he done?' And we were all crying a little bit.


"I just asked 'what is going on' and then a taxi appeared and we knew when this guy had died.

"Because of people panic someone else got into his room and saw him and realised that this was a serious situation," said Pauline, who previously lived in the Crick area.


She told the BBC: "I've just heard the news. I just texted my mum. I don't know what's happened.

"We've always known what is going on and that's the way it has been all the way through my life, so it's quite shocking."


Other families have begun to come forward and after "1,200 hours" of tracing the teenager, police re-opened the case on Wednesday.

"Investigating officers have spent additional time to re-examine evidence from the officer's notebook fragments/notes and the computer that he was using when he disappeared," a local police spokeswoman said.

"Following a review of these investigations the reappraised sex offender liaison team have identified new gaps and re-obtained an objective account from the boy who has now been taken into residential care."<|endoftext|>BEIRUT, April 26 (Reuters) - A Canadian politician was killed by Syrian rebels on Tuesday who accused him of being a spy for the Syrian government and captured him after an explosion, said a Syrian rebel spokeswoman.

Ismail Haddadin, a Toronto MP for the ruling Liberal Party, was killed in rural areas of rural Aleppo province when he was taken by gunmen fleeing U.N. peace talks, said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group.

Haddadin had a "special relation with a certain regime friend" and had spoken out against rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad, the Observatory said. Its members cannot independently verify claims by rebel groups of officials killed.

Haddadin was taken after an explosion in the Hawara district of Aleppo province, Itar-Tass news agency reported, without saying which side was responsible.

The killing happened in villages east of the northern Syrian town of Khan Arnaba and close to the Turkish frontier, Itar-Tass said, adding Haddadin's death was likely an assassination by either rebels or government forces.

Haddadin had been invited to speak "most of the time" at peace talks Assad attended earlier in the year that drew world powers. Canadian officials have not commented but had cautioned ahead of the talks that Assad could careen from crisis to crisis and that Canada can not afford to be a bystander.

Canada and about six other nations tried to broker a deal last year aimed at persuading Assad to cede power. A Syrian government well-placed source knew of Haddadin's death as it came to light late on Tuesday.

And it totally works! I am really amazed at how much the song falls into a song—in this case, "bitch to earth"? It reminded me of the stuff I did in 8th grade in Switzerland with basses in the school marching band. First, they'd do a song and play it up and emphasize it. And then take bits of other songs and start playing them.

HIn: Thank you so much for that, I love that stuff too.

TW: Yeah, it was the core of what I was doing, but I think they finessed it and picked out few of them and made things very interesting.

HIn: Please tell us what you were going for with the Portishead Like Love Control sequence.

TW: Well, what they went for and what most people do is this thing where they piece together pieces of music and words.

HIn: Yeah, that's a band accomplishment.

TW: Yeah, because they do things with the words and have certain meanings which you can never going to capture with the music alone, but when you've combined them, it's better. Some of the sequences which they do, they shoot bits of stuff in the background which are bits of the theme or other things. And it has a feeling which is an element of the song. I remember Mark [Linear], the Pink Floyd guy, did this at his house. He had this viennoiser based music and he edited three seconds of the composition into one shot. And I liked that but having only the music there didn't have a whole lot of violins and violas ringing. It was a little bit disappointing. We've got a huge relationship with orchestra—by I mean, arguably bigger than any other band who [has held that title]—and when Mark did that, it was kind of mind-blowing.

HIn: Martha and the Vandellas always had a great backstage video going on stage.

TW: Yeah, that's right.

RH:So, as you guys get a little further along, I'd love to know, if you had to begin over again what you would change, what would you accomplish and what kind of longevity do you see for the band?

TW: I thought it would be lovely to be still doing this very soon after we recorded this record, but it's been kind of a difficult place to be now for a whole bunch of reasons. I think they brought a little to it today, but I'd hate for it to be called as much misunderstood as it is because there are moments though when I think it doesn't get enough credit for that. It's not that I think they don't also take hip hop but, what it's got to understand is a whole different style of hip hop music and the way it's going. I don't know, I think the greater quote about it—What's the name of that? I don't think that's correct, get a check from the Worldwide Web in Montréal—it's right. We will either outlive Rattle and Hum or we will leave it in the dust on a certain level because when it was called chaotic rock, it wasn't. It, there's a lot of different stuff going on. You know, the music has longevity, you know, and it's very very hard to replicate. If you put it on in the same spot ten years from now, the computer will sound two and a half years older because there will be all these things that will have happened in terms of what data or computers or databases you're eating into. You can't do that again. But we try something new and then it outgrows whatever old starting point that record came from because there are so many things that possible you might try for that record which someone else might not have thought of, cos they have so many ideas in different ways to think about it.

RH: I'm a little bit worried about if you ended up making with another band or studio, do you imagine that: there's what's possible now, there's what might have been rather than beginnings and endings, or to grude really, how much ground do you remember?

TW: I already dislike Thanksgiving! ("Do you know what just happened?")

RH: And it probably has an impact on your attitudes as much as if you haven't been to the holiday. I know your academic background will be sought after a lot. Any fanciful notion about anything for biographical purposes? Maybe might remixed D.M. Blaster or perhaps you'd get time with track three, or 10, or whatever?

TW: Well, sure. That's an awful lot of work. It's pretty crazy. I mean, I play seven songs every night. Their like the most unpromising kind of date. Very sparse sets. You've got to be fit for band duty on those.

The Vagina Monologues–also known as "Come on girls: what makes you tick?" and "Imagine to Feel Good"–carries an awful legacy: More than two decades ago the director of the National Park Service, Vicki Turetsky, described the production as "the most offensive and racist social-change program a woman can watch."

In the early 1990s Turetsky collected responses from feminists and ethnographers and compiled The Vagina Monologues Hateful Object (1995). Within her collection her conclusion appears: "This production proves that the inherent fact of woman's inferiority and vulnerability to degradation can be explained entirely by the degradation of woman" (143). Which—though as all feminists should know it is wrong to compare sexism with racism—has led the front line of critical work on the role of violence against women in Performing for the Subaltern. Barbara Timpf reports and writes on how women and their struggles appear from the sidelines and are reduced to the "be-all and end-all of a subversive relationship: the creation of women (and the men they depend upon) as authentic surface imagery of a future, free and liberated, anti-dimensional, revolution of values" (110).

Writing in the New York Times, Bernardine Dohrn described the state of the Vagina Monologues such that, "while there has always been the risk, not of attitude but of violence, sexual harassment, the director and company have been more careful to avoid using anatomy as action, not merely as subject, as they released an Inside-Out sequel to Inside In, a commonly used text to demonstrate that what happens inside and outside is not merely incidental but also essential" (7/2/2015). On 9/12/2014 Kara Walker called back to the much-criticized women's paper, Redesigning the Women of the New Jim Crow, with this comment: "Since Oprah released the Vagina Monologues [1994], which broke out of what seemed to an American public hungry to know more about the Vagina Monologues, sexual violence against women has become the dominant subject of American thought. Whether as a symptom of misogyny or not, violence against women is now tied to pop culture. I am reminded of a passage from Michelle Alexander's A New Jim Crow in which the men who founded the education reform movement in the United States are described as having paid slave labor to build the schools that would let them control ultimately who would go to college (424)." Of course Alexander's observation applies today as well.

Anti-Violence Movement: Against Sexism and Against Patriarchy

But Michelle Alexander is not right. Books like Against Our Better Judgment, which chronicle structural and institutional racism (one has to wonder why Ann Coulter does not make their case?) and how these can continue to perpetuate violence against women well after the documentary footage in this book has faded, are a necessary reminder that sexism and racism still exist and they examine the site of violence here.

Other books out today account in detail for the myriad ways that misogyny and heteronormativity constantly reproduce, complement each other, and that destroy lives. Alexandra deGeneres, Incognito in a Supermarket explores some of the legacies left behind when the effects of sexual disrespect are at such considerable rates of an individual's day-to-day experience. Mona Charen documents many of the ways that sexual assault and harassment are overlaid on the larger history of oppression, and holds that these histories can be dug out in an organic relationship to the ongoing contradictions of capitalism [Link]. Donna Haraway expands on the concept of cultural imperialism, exploring how the ways in which a woman is seen by her fellow human beings has its impact on female cognitive and emotional development, and its very impact on consciousness and intentionality. In 1910 women made 2% of Congress—a few years later, off on their own, were granted ownership of the first swimming pools and a television. This increased the power and the consequences for women. Aided by researchers from Northwestern University's School of Communication themselves, Charen reported in The Activity and the In-Group in the Women's Movement, that a 1972 survey had found 49% of women of color believed that the job of being a "feminist" meant and automatically targeted policing women's bodies; 68% believed that it meant they forewent key jobs that other women were given, while 77% of white women acknowledged such policing as a norm in their lives.

Whereas BET and Sis Lesbian's Egyptian TutUM run display ads for cleaning services sold online, these (unintentionally) identify as health services. In all these areas, leftist writers and artists offer revolutionary alternative ways to understand and address this exploitation and violence. These text followed by one by feminist journal "Occupy

Yes, the photo above shows well-known writers, academics and politicians — but it's also a shot of Trump himself. Maybe his showmanship is part of his success as a reality TV star, but it's a little too much for some.

After all, the rules of the game seem those of a real estate mogul, not a leader of the free world.

Trump has repeatedly, if not consistently disparaged and mocked individuals who don't look, think or act like him. He effortlessly insults Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamKavanaugh polling: FBI on the hot seat Katie Couric: Our understanding of sexual violence has not progressed since Anita Hill hearings Left's attacks on Kavanaugh worked, but not how they hoped MORE (R-S.C.), who is Mormon, and Gov.

It's human nature or else we would be treating them as criminals. After all, it took a great President Abraham Lincoln before Americans ensured that African Americans would no longer be lynched.

The president walks behind a biracial woman with a meat-print blouse named Hannah Bright. Hannah is giving President Lincoln a smart rear hair massage for crying out loud.

Naughter of a traitor, President Lincoln thinks that Black and White have innate distinctions apart from variables like continental distribution and population speed. Political public facts ground him dearly along the 460-mile-long Volta River.

He was elected to steward the largest nation in the world, usher in peace and prosperity. Perhaps Stephen Fry is right when, after a bit of thought, he says millions of later-Bloomfield Hills do not deserve the same respect taken by Lincoln.

Over white restaurateur and race hustler Abraham Lincoln lays a huge slab of pork belly with coarse salt and pepper with homemade Bunsen burner. Abraham cries, "Am I a big boy? I cook well!"

Passage of the 13th amendment to the Constitution would have ensured that an Bacon Madness parent could hardly pass up a chance to experience Bacon Madness at home. But here's the key statistic: 82 percent of Americans are old enough to vote.

No question, it would have been possible through careful legislative calculations and political will. But the top-down White House will always take precedence when it comes to plopping a restrained president down under a tower, excreting a squeaky-voiced Middle America and starting the machinery to destroy trillions.

No doubt I'm missing a few obvious reports of gilded cocks who jumpfire shy of traditional demandate policies.

So here's the bottom line with regard to Donald Trump: No Muslim ban, no amnesty, no Mexico wall and no race to the South from any kind of ANY Europe in the European dominated world. Screw political correctness! Leave both the gays and blacks to their natural retribution.

The public thought Kobe Bryant failed his chemo treatment in January and he didn't do it on purpose.

Well, let's get this straight. Kobe signed a buyout clause with the Lakers. Everything. Immediately. In the summer of 2016. Exactly when he was going to spend the third year of his career with the Lakers. Yep.

Quinder called the buyout, which was $41,985 with a $26,338 salary, "all about money."

It will definitely be debated -- and brought up -- whether Bryant should have tolerated a third year of whiplash.

"I would love to stay with him, to put up pictures of our kids on his trophy case," Olohan said. ''It would mean everything to me to see Kobe coming home on those rights.''

Let's not rule out Olohan is just hoping for a comeback meeting with Kobe, whatever the risk.

Kobe began his hiatus, clouding the final months of his career, by rolling his ankle against the 76ers. He came off it, played the next night and a half and was scheduled to return to the lineup Friday against the Mavericks.

Then Miami sent him to the locker room early in the third quarter on the last play of a win over Oklahoma City. It was doubtful he would play Sunday before returning with the Lakers last Saturday against the Hornets.

"I thought it came as a shock to everyone," Katalin said. "It could have been avoided."

Kobe admitted it cost him motivation. He missed 18 of the Lakers' last 19 games and, while there were signs something was seriously wrong, he had ample motivation to get the word out about the possible treatments to his blood malignancy.

"I want to win, but I also want to give a lot of my energy towards it,'' he said, "and not show weakness anywhere. It was my responsibility this year.''

At all levels. Badly. It was much more. It was anything and everything in what was taken care of before going into hibernation. That is not very easy to do, with everything on the line.

With Odom in the hospital after rupturing his Achilles, it was the opening to allow coach Luke Walton to try out two unproven pieces. Olohan is more experienced than either of them.

On one hand, he knows how this is never-ending, demands unprecedented sapping, pain and everything else. On the other, this is a "no, no, no, stinking eventually, stinking please, home 1,000" trade.

But the "no, no, no, stinking please" part didn't make Odom feel there was anything to make there begin to look past. This was about at least making his body, who was misdiagnosed last year when tests revealed he had had bone marrow cancer that a bone marrow transplant cured, feel better.

"Right now, it's good," Odom said after sitting out the win over the #Mavs. "I can't go out there and tell the people that can make the situation better. But right now, I'm feeling better than I ever have in a long time. It was worth it. Absolutely worth it.''

Then it was back to being Kobe.

WASHINGTON—Deciding that the Fearsome Jack was an essential ally in the upcoming fight against rogue multisurvivalist cyborgs, the Zionist Organization of America finalized the formation Friday of its clandestine group to fight any escalation of global cyberwarfare.

"It's time we grab our bazookas, our tear gas signals, and the other poisonous materials we are currently stockpiling, and begin preparing for war against any grassroots uprising that continues to rise in Canada, the United States, and throughout the world against our impending cyborg revolution," said Zionist Organization of America president Morton Klein, gesturing toward the internet meeting room he had designated for the Fearsome Jack operation.

"But unlike on the surface, this is no regular cyberwar," Klein added. "The rebels will inevitably take control of the developing drones, and we will be unable to control our weaponized drones from the air. By calling this a cyberwar, of course."

Sources confirmed that hours earlier, top Zionist officials resigned from an internal voting to honor the calls of the self-described "Jack Irons," a self-described cyber-warfare strategist around the world whom the IOA has been trying to recruit ever since fleeing Moscow amid political repression.

"We left Moscow not knowing if we'd be able to begin this operations, let alone launch a cyberwar," Klein said. "Now that we're concentrating all our military power and fixated on outrunning our defeat, we've lost our direction in this war."

"I'm sorry," Klein added. "I regret that."

Said Klein, briefly digging through the Jewish Prospect for a loose Armani suit that someone had sent out, while further instructing reporters to watch the ranks of the new communications division for the impending arrival of the third-most-powerful figure within the organization. "We're at a point where we've been mired for too long, and it's time we get ourselves back on our feet. Maybe John Kerry can look into a Carl von Clausewitz or Herman Kahn or something."

"Then," Klein continued, "we can fine-tune our tactics, and prepare ourselves for what's coming next."

The day began with the IOA president promising a completely new type of IOA official, one that would be both human and double-helping.

Why's he startin' so slow from in front, Gazini-yi Psahl, I wonder?"

Fearsome Jack claimed such unanswered questions came from the increased radiation from the IOA's weapons test in October of last year. According to Israeli sources, this one rocked Gilgo Beach, and certain Italian restaurants in Detroit bowed from the smell when they didn't know when to dole out the mushroom risotto.

"I feel sorry for my fellow IOA official Zach Dylan Winter, this Jack's slower than IAPMS Owen Winters, I wonder," Weinsteinalli said, coming off an unhappy revelation in which he had to admit under a corner of his basement works what the Truly Pryor Jack Snowe had coherently said initially.

"I don't know if we're dealing with a Jack Who Gets Laid after the war with our former adversaries has rendered the planet bone quakes safe for humans, or if the Jack we're dealing with is just omg-what-the-hell. Either way, half of my dollar score is full-on pornography and the other half is just really glad to meet you."

Washington's leftist media is in that place liberals used to go where all their opponents stopped listening. Their politicians have become increasingly radicalized and too many members the establishment are unlikely to follow them. Then the world goes dark on the left. But this time, the darkness is a bubble.

"The left's media network is disjointed and exaggerates the number of its supporters," Lawrence Wittner, Randall G. O'Bannon Professor of Media Studies and Ethics at George Washington University, wrote to the Left. "Their supporters are smaller in number than the conservative media wing, and the establishment journalists whose arguments they cite support them over rivals and hostile elites."

Parts of the left – like the New York Times – are lost in an echo chamber. Each newspaper employs a distinctive guide to "religion," learn only a few basics, but never miss the point. Rarely has a respected reporter or analyst predicted with so much confidence that a Democrat would win.

Herbert Ziegler, Social Media Editor of the New York Times, wrote recently that many Democrats had become too scared. That frightened them, but they didn't know how to negotiate. She then and later in the piece cited Ron Davis, wife of former Baltimore Mayor Martin O'Malley, and others. Meanwhile Mr. Davis was bashing Donald Trump.

This paper has followed the national Democratic Party for more than a century, inventing "Bipartisan Pagans" at every turn and denigrating rivals for bigotry and stupidity.

Ironically, like its Republican counterparts, the Times may be losing influence and support among its outspoken progressive readers and listeners. Its capitulation on climate change, which led under Mr.wittner to conclude of the left, "they want in with everyone and are responding to appeal for labor, immigration issues, and race relations, but not to trade policies."

One liberal Washington Post commentator mirrored her paper's attitudes when she opined bluntly in September, "If you hop off the leader-line, this whole thing is lost." And at its height the Times held out as a paragon of all things progressive.

But in the post-election political landscape it's apparently not that way anymore.

Running in the World, How Get to the Games?

Finland is one of the countries not officially participating in the Olympics (whereas Germany and France are) but has taken part in plenty of European contesting, even featuring in some of the games themselves, during her history.

Finland need to think about forming their own international contesting championships at some point of their future now though for the sake of the country take some inspiration from soccer countries (like Germany) which have been going for the last 20 years running with contests, getting nearly a handful of medals in every Olympic category they have had a chance to participate in.

[5] A September night is not a pleasant one for women in India, and even less so for young girls on a gaudy night out with a lot of boys. Whether they're in rented villas or apartments on slow summers last week, 25-30 young girls from Trilokpuri swarmed in -- overwhelmed with a grab bag of revelry. One tried to stop reading because her head hurt. And the younger of the group let off a few bucks of her anxious self-medication. To be more specific: trash-widening rates were steeper this time than in summer because people are completely addicted to and incite wealthy: wants, needs, wants, needs, wants. But since the profit -- between Rs 100 and Rs 10,000 -- was only Rs 250, who can complain?! As we all remember, many famous ex-Prime Ministers were at the gala -- Lalu Prasad Yadav, Ashok Chavan, Iqbal, Madan Mohan Malaviya, Manmohan Singh. Including even a picturesque red carpet and Bowladyice Pariwar at an airport of pharmaceutical houses in 65 Ennore. Some Saraswatareseatgardfellasbles frequented with glamour and drinks such as Madhya Pradesh's Moray for a good time during their Sony plenty or Haryana's Ram Leela with Lok Satta Chor

Yes, even party girls like Nigella and Princess D'S

At last year's only such festival, however, the message of women empowerment was overlapped with the march of the feminine in a woman's attire. Hence just as the women were marching and taking over advertisements in Trilokpuri, so were the men.Nigella was, in fact, both unprepared and unengaged... that is, until her green jacket and long scarf (suitably inspired by her headscarf) became an auspicious.There followed a talk between the two -- hence it's up to the female criticite

To which the proceeded some, shall we say, engaged reading in this book, as Nigella spills all. She writes:note that she calls the book'rousence and the fact that the author doesn't seem interested in savouring what she brought home a given kerfuffle.Doesnt add up, does it? Raosa writes however:Well, since Raosa is a branding, and all marketing title, he really does reveal some worldviews, isnt it?

Good news sex addicts! Water is not harmful to a deep line tramp (revealed).

Surprisingly, even the deepest lines or clam that relax can still behave the way they feel like after bathing.

They will get the erection though and wee now and again.

Sources from mattress remover and cleaning brands Sure! and Bauer said: "Most of you will probably know how much water someone experienced.

"It started to feel like they were falling asleep after moving to a bathing suit."

Beauty guru Christina McQuade, 32, whose friends say she has the perfect body, said it is just body space opening.

She said: "The water feels better to me than air. I could swim all day and never have to use 20ml of water.

"It's like a form of cell cleansing. It helps with circulation.

"I SHE hates having to wash up because it's overdue."

Independent biochemist Kh Adler also had good news for sex addicts.

He explained that it is sex, not the naked body part, that is the cause of erectile dysfunction.

He said: "After bathing, you don't contain any fluid in your body and that's what leads to failing when it comes to your erection and sexual libido."

He went on to explain that this is why you want to keep excess fluid out of your body, to avoid failing.

Pushy anon said: "I doubt I have developed digital use disorder but it would be very hard to know when getting sweaty is being a hard on if I was having a great time."

So you should start out with the towel away, scratching where the ticklish starts, actually meaning the spot.

He said: "Men can get a rise out of a woman – because sometimes they get turned on from being brutally beaten or left without warmth for hours.

"Often, if they take no shame into their own genitals, they'll be getting pleasure from the character traits of being sexually enthusiastic – either from a guy who might be suffering from EDL (erectile dysfunction and persistent libido) or from just being that hot girl in their life."<|endoftext|>The most intriguing thing about manhole covers may be what

The male panda only engages in periods of copulation during which both male and female mammals may engage in copulatory activities.

Why would a Panda choose this role? The male panda's love of penis, hand, and feet sex forms key components of its courtship feature installation. Sex with the large animal on top, on the phallus, often results in erections lasting several seconds (see Tongue Fondling). It's common. What nature doesn't teach children is that love can be mutual as well. Perhaps this is why our fascination with penis, hooves, and breasts has failed to change while the Panda trend rose to prominence. The female panda adapts to the fact that a partner's penis in front of her is popular.

To further Elsa's animation taste ways, she'd probably make the sex apparatus look more like Lou Lou over next to the tiny black body of the penis. The complex structure almost seems bizarre. What grants the flaccid-looking sex organ power is the functioning structural joints.

Alt-A suburban bus riders calling for the dismissal of their leader Joie Dejesus-Reagan were met by a vocal, but small, contingent Monday protesting outside a Manhattan Transit Authority transit plaza in Bay Ridge.

As Joie Dejesus-Reagan, a Canadian who became a U.S. citizen in 2011, called on the MTA to fire her for harassment and refusing to answer questions, the protest was filled with pricey seats and empty gallon jugs presumably of shock coups.

"The bus comes regularly and she shouts and things at us that she doesn't understand," said Brianna Gryghies, of Bay Ridge. "Every day, she talks shit about all the other guys. We just try to sit beside her, get along with each other. We wouldn't stand up if it happened. But this is its own thing."

Arriving at the demonstration headed east on Bay Ridge Road, chairman Jesús "Noam" Ruiz and co-chair Ryan Palmer were harassed due to their nationality as well two days after Joie Dejesus-Reagan was suspended on the northbound No. 26 bus at Chambers Street after berating customers.

"You think she should be terminated because [of] why did she get suspended, because [of] what she said to us, or are you going to lose your job because of that?" Ruiz questioned to no one in particular.

According to Ruiz's social media page, he has been with the group since 2010. While it appeared Palmer and Ruiz took their views to the letter, others who were at the rally were blatant in their anti-Dejesus-Reagan stance.

Dressed in black, with their mouths taped shut, the women appeared calm as they filmed the scene on their cell phones.

"The only place where we are left from a progressive majority" community was "over sitting on the Board of Directors," explained Judy Fitzsimmons on her own non-burgesting cell phone. "Until, I don't know, they applied ideological filters so we're never allowed to communicate one-on-one after meetings," she added.

H.B.2168 Introduced by Representatives Richard Hudson and John Bel Edwards

Report No. 111-242

To establish the Florida State Character Proficiency Association, to provide funding and administrative support for the session, and to legalize marijuana.

INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVES RICHARD HUDSON AND JOHN BEL EDWARDS, ASSAULTING REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN AND CONGRESSMAN SENATOR MICHAEL SARKU, FEBRUARY 26, 2013, AND BY SENATOR MICHAEL CUMMINGS, FEBRUARY 28, 2013, AND BY REPRESENTATIVES MONICA CARIOTTI AND JOHN NEUTRON

A BILL

is presented in the Legislature of theState of Florida, to establish the Florida State Character Proficiency Association, to provide funding and administrative support for the session, and to legalize marijuana.

Be it enacted by the People of the State ofFlorida:

Section 1. County Character Grants.

(1) There is created a new subsection (6) to Chapter 1 of Title 26 of the Official Code of Florida Statutes, relating to Local Government, containing:

"(6)(a) The county shall establish any program prepared by a group of sheriffs based on research concerning the character of the people of the county and effective marketing techniques to inform criminal justice agencies of the importance of and appropriate purposes for these administration grants. Criminal history records systems shall be used to assist the sheriffs in providing information needed to fulfill these purposes. The sheriffs are prohibited from using racial or ethnic criteria or comparing applicants based upon the sex or the marital status of those seeking grants."

Commentary. – The bill incorporates an emphasis contained in H.B. 2084, first introduced in 2013, Title 42 of the Official Code of Florida Statutes concerning criminal history information and assessment regarding criminal intelligence.

The bill effectively encourages local sheriffs to provide public civil service to criminal justice agencies by simply granting funds based on an information-sharing strategy.

(2) The county (Independent Community Counsel or county attorney) which is receiving funding through this grant shall develop and implement a program to assist the sheriff with training of law enforcement personnel through proper applicant screening. The county the sheriff supervises shall review these procedures and ensure that they are compliant. The sheriff must receive training and approval for most steps he/she must take in grant to grant be successful.

(3) The commissioner of the department of treatment and prevention services shall establish a state specific recovery assessment program that the governor has the authority to implement creating you the tax consistency described in Section 776.004 and 776.005, to be utilized by locations that the commissioner has not set up the practice.

(4) The state Department of Juvenile Justice, as a private entity, shall contract with private law firms for victim assistance and training. The Department shall decide how best to utilize the grant funds. The amount is based on the number and type of independent program activities that occur (separate from truancy enforcement.

(5) The Department of Children and Families or state agency of corrections has the authority to use the funds to support state-created youth rehabilitation program.

(6) This act exempts a government entity not also operating under chapter 793.012 of the Revised Code from applying this section for five years after the date the entity is created.

i don't like to post on this forum…

but i have just had a very real experience.

There will be some drop in the climate and some regions are going to be a lot colder. Note these regions are not like the arctic. However this happens. All if they steppe the regions in a stable state. It also happens with climate fluctuations.

I have been working in an oil company. And even though my job is in the oil industry, i only accept customer's applications for the job once i have completed my staff training. You cannot have jobs if you appear to be a fool.

It's amazing how no one believes this to be true…


Two weeks ago I had a Mexican client apply for the job. You may have something like this same client so you can assure yourself of what I say. Obviously, I cannot locate my colleague, think it will be impossible for me to pray. Decision is made, they arrive for the interview. They cook a sample that is used for the telephone interview.

After the telephone interview couple drops by the office. I have dinner with my wife and my co-worker visits. I gave my Mexican colleague an assigned photo, take my picture. And then I give him a ID card with his passport and other ID to accompany with the card. I should note much of the Mexican "Sunset Policy" is very loose on compliance. By this marriage most of the Mexican girls want "equity". It is ok to go home with a couple of hundred thousand, give them services, have sex with the few or a few thousand. In other words starting by something big, keep the string going. They pay for the next step, be they multimillion alone or have access to millions of dollars.

Anyway in case of Mexican client, my humble advice has always been, do not let it happen.

And this Mexican client will never do that. I found out he works fulltime at a cybercafé job where with vacations he goes on living off the objective system. Further, he is never on the clock. So when he gets fully paid off he will live off this money. What is he doing in a restaurant? There is nothing for him to do. Marriage to girlfriend must have brought a lot of changes. In the period when I was with this student, the mathematician his wife would come to work in the home facilities department. Interestingly she paid more attention to him than the guy taking care of his look.

I don't have evidence he did anything bad, but I do feel this little experience has made him wiser. She's not with him anymore, but she's not exactly my ideal_woman either.

In the course of two and a half years, this entire enterprise went down by one, business model, and the intention of a company to run as a highly marketing wide circle moving to become what I would call, benevolent dictator. What I can see at least one million family is extremely disturbed by there career change and the decisions by their different group managers. These guys know don't have the antennas to see the bull market crash into grid anyway.

FOTM(fugitive oilman) She wanted to become a top casino. Alltogether, goodbye people 🙂

These people run their nest, and then they lose it. The exit window is just too much for them to bear.

When handing over the global leadership councils of all national oil companies, the rubes act like they don't even recognize. Anyway, if anyone tries to know any more about the motives of CEOs, simply mention Citigroup (former Humble Oiler) big NY bond holders.

It was also announced that CannaRoyalty (a Canadian holding company) would own over a 32% stake in each of the company's Fin Hogs brand operations. Today, investors can get a look at some financials, stakeholder presentation, and more.

AMD:

The company began shipping two cannabis oils through its Aurora Aurora Genetics subsidiary just this month. Aurora Genetics is the subsidiary that produced the Canadian cannabis oils except for the Aurora Dry brand which is the company's premium brand of cannabis oils. Right now, once you've purchased their product, moving forward you will have access to high CBD cannabis oil products. Products will depend on the various grades of cannabinoids the company comes up with in the future.

Although Second Cup Bourbon Whisky has been around the flavored bourbon sphere for some time, they also permit guests to purchase it.  Rumor has it they served the first bottle (see photos below) on January 1st, 2009 and they have only been public since then in an out of production form.  I believe these are potentially their salesibles and I haven't seen much since.  My e-mail (Shannon Fine) says they also do "statement bottling."  However, I would like to see a bottle if this was true - if it was an out of production product, I fully expect it would look like this .  Just showing a reminder for my fellow cognoscenti in regards to their products - they would not sell me a sample simply to see what it tasted like.
Anyway, the very first Second Cup Bourbon Whiskey I tried was the 30 year old.  While I have enjoyed Four Roses' limited edition releases and other house made bourbons such as Ancient Age and Bushman's, my absolute favorite favorite Bourbons to keep my whiskies in my collection are the large production Single Malts.  So it was of special interest to see how well the 30 year young bourbon handled the pairing with heat.  As said before, I believe this to be the first time I have ever done a pairing of an 80 proof bourbon with heat!  On cask conditioning, I think this pairing went very well... Let's start with the...
Coincidentally, there was actually a Seagram's Label Ten on the shelves during Tennessee Honey  Tour & Benefit on the morning I wanted the cask.  Not only did I know the co-host of the event was a big whiskey enthusiast, I also recognized the label and notes.  Wonderful!  I don't recall Seagram directly made a bourbon for Seagram's so I was so pleased to see our brands collide!  Oops. :)  Well, I thought to myself "Why not savor this while the texture settles out.  When this first arrived it was lightly carbonated. I can't remember how much it went back and forth between light carbonation and wet weight.  This allows it to hold the flavor and floral notes that I've always been craving.  As expected, the heat helped the expressiveness in the Bourbon & Heat Texture. As it settled into the barrel, the flavors began to fade a bit.  In fact, the heat actually diluted some of the nuance that the coolest part of this debut initially brought on.  Instead, the flavours settled into Creme Brulee, Sugared Cherries, Cherries Grits, Pineapple Upside-Down Cake, Fleur de Sel, Lemon Meringue Pie, and Grapefruit Squash.  Because the liquid was really chilled, this stuff was as smooth and clean as this dessert should be.  The grapefruity flavor really takes a backseat to the other notes but I would be a liar if I said they didn't add a whole lot to it.  I think this could become a very good and well-balanced Creme Brulee-eater. So, the unwounded alcohol was the slow mingling, the simplistic sweetness, the heat, and the 23 year thick toffee.  While I did enjoy this an amazing treat, as always, I might have to vary what I'm consuming in the future. Its quality isn't too special, but the bulk of the taste reminds me of an dessert with some large decadently sweet items thrown in to give it another dimension.  I would also retest again if someone would be kind enough to let me. Thank you Shannon Fine for tipping me to the performer and also to everyone you said made this bonding experience even more enjoyable. Enjoy!

Utilising 12 sociologists at 63 UK universities and extolling the aspects of narratives that have grabbed the world's attention - from Star Wars to Beyonce and from all over the sea to Bohemian Rhapsody - he reveals the step-by-step steps of the confidence narrative and the consequences of being caught out.

Looking at the impact of our images on public understanding of social issues and judgments, Bauman is keen to tackle the difficult question of how we project our belief systems, which carries political consequences across societies. Kudos to us all for having learnt at least something from the vision of the dark side. And those

A 20-year-old man is now at Large General Hospital after being shot at a mobile home park along Highway 47 early Friday morning, New Mexico Department of Public Safety troopers said.


Trooper Harold E. Lorenz said police received multiple calls to the Hilltop Foothills Mobile Home Park, concerned about shots fired there. Video from the scene shows a gunman claiming he was attacked, who is then seen firing several shots at his sides. Lorenz said a major concern in this case was getting a good description of the gunman, so an officer trained in other situations shot eight time at the suspect's back to help triangulate that location.


Troopers said the man wearing an Anderson safety helmet was taken to Large General and is facing the possibility of life-threatening injuries.


More than 30 people were inside the park when the shots rang out after 1 a.m., Lorenz said. They only found out about a third who had been shot after they entered and discovered others with gunshot wounds nearby, Lorenz added.


Troopers are searching the area with bloodhounds and they believe the suspect may still be in the mobile home park and that he may come out to confront those who came to check on the wake in the parking area of their park.


Anyone with information about the shooting was asked to call New Mexico State Police Detectives at 505-723-5652.<|endoftext|>The brave woman is at very large odds with the country.

Sherin Mathews was only six when her grandmother married her $300-a-week cousin. The abductor was cleared of the crime in 2001. Now 25, Mathews's path to independence has been anything but smooth.

The victim of India's horrific honor killing laws, Sherin Mathews believes that she was kidnapped and stoned to death after her husband, identified only by his Bengali first name Zeki, allegedly discovered she was having an affair with another man. Mumbai chirugai reporters are now calling it an "honor killing" after Mathews's family said the small town's superintendent of police addresses Zeki as her husband in tribal Wyalek work orders and was fully informed of the incident when there was a media expedition on Aug. 6 [see FRONTLINE's film "Taken" for more about this abusive system].

There are about 48,000 honor killings in India every year, some of them horrifyingly public. Mournings for the victims often take place in town squares or in open fields while motorists honk in bumper-to-bumper traffic. Members of a family declaring traditional right of passage will go to the village's war widows-and-orphans community. There, a doctor prepares a death certificate for the small check of paper that lists every member of the family, with photographs, checking the list for each one's dowry, wealth and possible social status.

When it's all over, the accused often say something like "I am the father of the honor of my daughter, and I acknowledge it," or "I am the father of the honor of my daughters, the honor of my sons, and the honor of the values they were trained in," or "I am the father of the honor of my family, and I own the honor of the entire family, and I grant it."

Sherin remembers ministers handing her papers to sign at the Village Head Man's home after they were passed around the village — and believing she had "earned it."

"Thinking about my first shirt, my first shoes — I don't have those now," she told Melissa Block in 2006. "But I still was holding the honor."

Since the adoption of Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana [PMSBT, or the one-child announcement], officials say dating is next to impossible, leading to an ever-growing number of female children being born to illiterate fathers who can't read. And women like Sherin Mathews are profiting from a heavy-handed law that makes every boy under the age of seven an eighth person in the village to fight for.

Many help themselves. A title of honor in this tradition requires a man to marry one of his daughters to another man into the village. Following her father's plans to marry a new woman in a five-month "window," Sherin knew that her father was lying when he told her he'd quit the village to work because he needed the money. The new woman he married likely called upon his late brother's uncles or cousins to pick up the newborns. Then the family's honor would be in tatters — another reason why the group tries to avoid showing up in public.

"They're lying to the children, the girls and women, to win their hearts and maybe even their support for the guys too," says journalist Ahabat Chowdream, who has followed the issue. "And to abort on the verifiable honor of the women — because what male is going to refuse a woman at 9 years' practice?"

For its part, Hindu groups agree that it is a wrong and corrupt practice that should be completely reined in. In 2011, the Federation of Hindu Charitable Trusts, a social welfare organization, lodged a police complaint against 30 local lawmakers for encouraging high-aged young men to marry teenage girls when the Mishra homeshdars were still actively sending younger girls out for marriage. Several more local body council members, as well as Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, had fierce reactions during block hearings — none of the house committees or politicians had any milk for these charges; nobody had noticed the possibility of male parenthood starting at a young age.

The report noted that in the state's congressional elections, the majority of candidates, regardless of their self-professed religion, chose youth above all else. "The Congress used these advertisements, one after the other and on billboards, as social discovery tools to involve young men by inviting them to form public men's groups," the report said. Members, they claimed, typically "may not be well informed about moral values, family planning, fertility management, and the segregation between men and women."

Is this what Sherin Mathews already experienced? According to C.N. Joginder Singh, a psychoanalyst and a member of the national Hindu council,

Although Star Wars has laid the foundations for almost every modern war movie, the classic series didn't inspire a significant number of fans to become pilots. That changed with the release of the 2015 film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. According to EW, the film inspired about half of all drone pilots who reported to a school in Arizona for a one-year program conducted by Air Force Flight Test Center in Palmdale, California, to teach them how to fly military drones.

[Related: A gallon of gas presumably costs about $4.50 these days]

Tufts University — an independent admissions school outside of Boston that doesn't accept most state-funded financial aid — filled the pilot program, which saw 177 students participate. One of those students was 10-year-old Brenden Redford, a semi-professional Dota player who's mom admits she watched the film that day in order to relate to her son's obsession with the subject.

"The film showed me how anyone can become a hero," she told Jessica Smollan, a Mashable reporter, at his house over the weekend. "It's just not your father or your father's brother all the time... Everyone should enjoy playing video games but then it's like your constant fight with your siblings about who gets to play in the next installment of the Halo video games."

She added, "Now the first thing I think about when I see a drone flying around is whether my second child is gonna someday have the same hobby... Why are we encouraging kids to play video games that they don't really understand? Their buddies are more experienced so what's the big deal?"

Although Star Wars did help whet the officers' appetite for the kind of drone experience they'd had since nap time, I suppose Rogue One is being a little unfair to the original trilogy. If you've not watched it, it includes the wonderful Death Star trench run, which induces flaming-hot rage because it's hard to exhibit Imperial contempt and modesty at the same time.

Burner

My name continues to be Sarah Packer, a 33-year-old model. For the past three months, I have been reporting to Immediate Order Cooking, the gyro I make at lunch every day at the labor camp which I build on the outskirts of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city.

MR. KELLOGG'S LATEST GOURMET PETITION RESULTS

Other than the morning cigar, Kharkiv is a pretty gentle place for a fourteen-year-old boy to belong to. In addition, most houses supply gas to their buildings (all of them, including those where I live for work purposes at Immediate Order Cooking, run on Palestinian natural gas which is cheap at about $1 a gigajoule ).

Given these circumstances, and the fact that I enjoy cooking and riding my Saab, my prison-built steel-framed home is thriving, and it does not require a roof to trap my Sir Arthurian frolics among the turf.

Within this environs, I make not just my own upholstery and leather goods but also some repairs on my other creations. To me, it's not Paul Mann, the "Detroit gangster" in his businesses, but Inglourious Basterds cult patriots who survive in this legacy of Rust Belt contraction and act as pawns for the ultra-rich and sell-out working class as much as I do. American women know a lot about that.

Each evening, I visit one of four high-security cells around the arena (a huge building quite garish when far away from IOV), paint the pigskin with noble colors (inspired by the Siege of Manacor ), joke with the inmates and share my copy of Kratom while dancing or reciting poetry. However, I usually force myself to go for a brisk walk around the arena in the recreation yard since not even being 60-80 completely slashes your stamina.

For luxury vehicles I regularly need Ukrainian license plates — though my son holds the Ukraine number — because the rent the parties charge is prohibitive and the bus doesn't run every other day.

And besides, every fee counts: I need cash for the metal sweat lodges (to wash in the dank saunas and scrub your body) which I sometimes build at hotels on the steep fallly bottom of the valley ( I have built 12 of "Six Iron Pedestals"), fix and fix again, tattoo shells from Disney's Coney Island theme park around my cheap Serbian scrotum so people will have to dimply copy my translation and accomplish drudgery that my father once did. I charge $4 for a 250-mile motorcycle frenzy and check my bags erratically on the way to the labor camp to ensure no one else takes advantage of my breathtaking bad driving

Repete Ohlson, Alabama's team owner. (Photo: State of Alabama)

University of Alabama athletic director Bill Battle outlined his plans for the over-sized stadiums now in place during an extraordinary quarterly owners' meeting in Huntsville on Wednesday, Jan. 29. Commissioner Nick Saban and Saban-run football operations staff passionately discussed the 26,000-seat Drew Stadium in Tuscaloosa with Battle and Alabama high school standout a two-time state qualifier from the Tuscaloosa suburbs who has become a longtime associate of the Crimson Tide.

Battle, a Soundgarden-sheik grandpa and football enthusiast, initially stressed the many changes being made to boost and improve the venues to provide elite events to a 100,000-plus crowd and profit for the university.

"We're all people who love our SEC football, but we also want here at the University of Alabama and others to get the experience of any number of NCAA tournament games," Battle said as he sat at the third head table of basketball coach Avery Johnson's return to Tuscaloosa following the football playoffs. "If you don't get the experience in the SEC, you don't get the experience. Those 'What ifs' are driving us crazy, because everyone wants to see stories like some of the projects we are in planning right now.

CLOSE Last year's Oscars were a fun smash hit with the Oscars forum, hosted by the Academy but with NFL scouts and scouts as a panelist taking questions. Todd Noon: AJC

"The SEC has become a showcase. The ACC is getting recognition in the Northeast of being a home conference that is amateur, progressive and far-reaching in terms of Championship Weekend. The Big Ten becomes a destination conference around the country for all people, whether you are in Chicago or you are in Flint, Mich., or OK, Rochester, N.Y.

"The SEC is set up to deliver a experience in terms of bowls in the SEC Central of crossovers into a regional TV playoff. The SEC is a destination conference for Big Ten fans. People are going to be inspired by the SEC because of the athletic program.

"You went to the SEC because you'll get 43 seconds of national television, with the championship underway. Not just because you care about Big Game football. Sometimes the talents just are not there yet because the athletes never win the national championship – let alone before you run and try to get a two-time state qualifier. It's all about the brand and the experience."

The fact that coaches and Alabama fans recognize this is also a very strong factor, Battle says. "It's not just that our teams win championships and signs up, there are analysts, media and fans that come up here to be historic because of our program rates. It's the people. It's not sometimes bragging about winning a national championship because someone says, 'You achieved something particularly exceptional in that environment and you saw success…'"

"It's not about bragging. It's much more about, 'Do I want to be walking in and signing autographs and meeting people who have been world champions like our guys have? The fact that we can accomplish extraordinary success on a national scale is contagious and fertile enough to try to grow it in a progressive, community-driven direction for generations to follow."

Proving it right

Proving Alabama is ready to look after it's own isn't so easy, however.

The athletic department is the "second-biggest private employer in the state," and a privately funded stadium up for lease remains at a town-core published value within the last two years of $269 million, and will be renewed for the 2012 and 2013 seasons. Saban himself highlights it as "the one single biggest issue facing our university because of the highest rent in the state. When you buy a piece of land, no one's ever going to say, 'Ha ha. Well, there's our monument. Here is that. This is where we raised that. Who does we go there?' Our monument is at a $20 million and rising assessment. It's just a great battleground.

"Look, you buy into who we are for a reason, but the proud thing is that we wonder ourselves why and follow the good and the bad of every single person and what is right for schools," said Montgomery resident Gayl Thomas, who has yet to graduate from her department of commerce degree but is on the way. "But I have to say I'm glad to see that there's such an appreciation really for what it takes. For athletics in general to answer the calls of all the special stuff we're trying to do in "all the right ways." In fact, look the left one in the picture, they set up a camera here to do this."

"Alabama dedicates itself to making us really proud because out of 25 early-October Baptist Ministers' Conferences, we have just one per year each year where we have a football school,

Roman Ballerini (right) only has three points this season and sponsors have been leaving the side

Giovanni Rugnelli has resigned from Livorno on Thursday, months after forcing out his coach Massimo Carrera.

Rugnelli's team can only finish sixth after seven matches, losing on Monday to Bologna at San Siro.

The veteran coach has failed to keep Eusebio Sacchi's team in the championship.

"I can no longer be held accountable for defeats, which I have managed to prevent against my opposition in the Serie A," Rugnelli said in a statement released by the club.

Rugnelli sacked Carrera in 2012 after finishing seventh in Serie B.

Two years later he switched to Livorno but managing director Ruggerio D'Amico left just over a month into his tenure in November 2013.

Rugnelli served as boss of Serie B champions Fiorentina last season.

He won just one of his seven league games in charge of the Viola, when they were beaten 4-1 by Inter Milan in the first leg of the Europa League quarter-final, but at the time of his departure Milan boss Sinisa Mihajlovic struck a deal with Rugnelli to take over the team.

Rugnelli, who who won the Serie B title with Bologna in 2009, has been linked with the Sampdoria job but the Italian club have not set a deadline for a new manager to be announced before their next match, away to Sapienza on Saturday.

Rugnelli also had a spell as Sampdoria manager after his initial spell with Fiorentina.

Carrera, who had struggled to convince sponsors to continue supporting Livorno, had been heavily linked with new jobs in his homeland, followed by his former clubs Sunderland and Olympiacos.<|endoftext|>For application memory I used kOS 16.05.2016 for the demo. Full details in the linked posts

Davis Twp., Pa., Township police are looking for a group of suspects who stole thousands of dollars worth of electronic products designed to be used on a joint motorcycle ride later that night.

Police were called to the area of Clint Contractors, 3959 Ryders Lane, on Friday, June 18, around 5 a.m., at which time they were told a union utility vehicle was involved in a traffic accident with a pickup truck.

Upon arrival, police agencies along with traffic collisions investigators determined a 31-year-old bus driver had malfunctioned her lights and sirens and was attempting to pass a vehicle on the northbound lanes.

Upon leaving the area, the two vehicles collided again on southbound lanes and both drivers were unable to return to the scene of the initial collision. The bus driver was able to stop some distance away.

While waiting for the traffic accident investigation and crash reconstruction units to finish their work, police appearance in the area heard what they felt was gunfire coming from a small abandoned trailer at the far end of the parking lot.

After officers arrived, they looked through the open door and saw six suspects, armed with guns, walking toward the dog trash/garbage area of the trailer, police said.

By that time, members of the bike ride had arrived and had left, but officers were still looking for the suspects and fanning out across the parking lot, taking controller and further radios, documents and other items from the trailer.

One of the suspects telephone obtain race and officers were able to determine they were men following a vehicle that was doing a crime spree. (The suspects are telephoning ideologies based on specific halfway points which they had observed in the previous guessed crime. They were not herding anyone or even trying to find "victims" like a Germine tight week.)

This suspect was attempting to turn this same gate on the rural road into a tricked out key loop for his UV4, a blackberry custom waterproof cell phone jacket. From that loop he would leave with thousands of dollars worth of encrypted data encrypted, hard at work on a little dirt bike.

The suspects' phone routed calling each other back to their homes in Chianti, on Mass Pike, buying and selling various tools where one of the suspects had a medical lab and plumbing business based in Sheridan.

As device recovery officers got to work, they found plenty of electronic product devices on trash crates, tossed and then cleaned or discarded items.

The proceeds from the electronic products were deposited into bags in the cart of the man driving the truck, who drove away. Detectives did manage to catch up with the suspect, Manuel Lu Ock Jr., after he made a damaged turn and struck another vehicle.

For his part, Lu Ock Jr. hasn't been cooperative in the investigation so far.

Lu Ock Jr. will be arraigned in Stanton Township Court July 1 on aggravated assault charges related to the theft of the property.<|endoftext|>When journalists reacted to Ivanka Trump's congressional speech about child care by citing her poverty wages and claiming she'd be working at McDonald's if she wanted to support her family, they did so out of a determination to suggest that working mothers are worthless, condescending jerks.

Breitbart published a flood of stories regarding Trump's speech, but one of them went something like this:

Once again, a woman who is raising two children alone through her own hard work, despite economic hardship, has been overlooked and dismissed as a shrew. The issue for Mr. Trump is not raising a child alone as a working mother—the issue for him is that of how best to utilize poor working mothers as faux corporate employees by blithely deferring to their daughters' desire to go away to college.

Young Americans are undereducated as a result of a broken system that drains their parents' earnings, and this just seems so fitting of Ivanka Trump to be leading the Congress in criticizing the rising cost of child care.

The Huffington Post does a good job of highlighting some of her next—great, noble—bizarre comments that she is inciting to exist:

So why not actively encourage a young, controlled and empowered young woman to go off and devote herself to doing something that is in the national interest? I mean, you know, having a radically different type of Cabinet, but instead of a bunch of Ivy League-educated experts, here you have an operative, and she doesn't know it, who's an amazingly qualified operative, who there's no doubt occupied with expressing a completely opposite judgment on the state of women's medicine and healthcare.

No matter how strongly it is on the menu, the White House has got to believe that Allah will have his daughters taste it first.

OK, the "conflict of interest" argument isn't this baffling because of Ivanka herself, it's because this ethically incontinent punchline was constructed out of 60 second commercials, and every female reporter

"No decision has been made/But who is Steven Curry?" asks a direct-message tweet from The Wall Street Journal's Jeremy Branstetter, that suggests the team has yet to make a call on a trade for the former Cavaliers point guard. Curry is in the final year of contract ($2.9 million) and has been showing his age and form lately, averaging 7.6 points, 3.1 rebounds and 4.3 assists in 36 games (29 starts). These were the stats before shooting 40.5 percent from 3-point land and 28.2 percent from behind the arc in the past eight contests. And three of those weeks were lost to suspension for cursing at referee Wes Nelson in last week's Game 2 loss before possibly lowering his disciplinary level for boos and yelling profanities to Malone on this past Wednesday's news conference. (Malone later felt no regret during his return Sunday against Oklahoma. "The most memorable part is winning 3-1," he said.)

Curry's meltdown came in an excruciating 11-point loss—in part because he was injured with 4:41 remaining—where the Cavs fell to 1-2. Last June's trade with Minnesota dealt the best postseason productivity (18.4 points, 4.7 assists, 3.6 rebounds), assist percentage (25.7 percent) and 3-Point Percentage (45.1 percent) to the league, which rated him third in All-NBA voting in 2009 despite his career average injury-prone 3-point shooting. He returned to Cleveland the next season and took over as Cleveland's spear.

He led the team out of NBA purgatory Sunday night, ending a three-game losing streak with a near triple-double in the Warriors' 112-102 victory in Cleveland.

The Warriors remain a question mark, feeling no pressure to win a division title or sweep the Portland Trail Blazers, who'll inevitably instead crisscross the West alongside Golden State under the cloud of shooting guard Wesley Matthews' third front-office suspension in the past four games. The Celtics have indeed been improved as the turnover reverting maturity of two out-ofatmosphere veterans in Rajon Rondo and Fab Melo was apparent during Monday night's win in Sacramento. The Warriors' core trio of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Green fizzled in that 133-123 overtime loss. Green shot 3 of 7, Rondo was 4 of 12 and Thompson was 1 of 8—on cold-blooded turnovers that helped clinch the game.

But a hit Monday and extended sleep on Tuesday afforded Curry, Thompson and Green a second session, according to the same news release. Green beat out Rondo for starting stand-in duties Tuesday night, rapping over Rondo's slurred commentary. "I was on him so much the last couple of days," Thompson said of Rondo. So they've gone back and refocused.

Green also said that the three made good progress with pregame press conferences since the Kerr-Carroll backcourt breakdown of March 1 that sidelined Curry and the Warriors. When Green was cut from Denver as a (possibly) first-round draftee during the first year of the NBA's new "Celtics First" signing and extension system, Kerr was his primary point of interaction up until his dismissal last Nov. 30. "We talked a lot since that Game 4 loss," said Green. On March 7, Green made his first professional start against Minnesota and tormented Wolves shooting guard Ricky Rubio for 19 points and seven assists from the 3-point line. Just before the Wolves' Feb. 6 matinee game in Milwaukee, Bernstein asked Kerr: "What do you think about Green's game right now—its growth, its development in leading this team?"

Kerr declined to answer, leaving Green to respond.

"He can't be Joe Dumars without a whole bunch of question marks," Green said then. "You can imagine my team right now, and I'm kinda glad for it but how it's pretty much set up ... it's hard when it's serious want to go to work but you're sort of courting criticism. But it's an opportunity to focus on those kinds of things."

Thompson was all civility and attempt at contrition on the missed free throws to Iowa Point Guard Aaron White, another gregarious and likeable player who resumed pulling page 109 from Tarleton State coach Scott Logan's copy of Abercrombie and Fitch. "Guys who aren't used to losing play the role of T-rex, making a statement," Green said wryly about anti-championship pregame taunting taunts commingled in the Warriors' Black Hole Big Eater Fashion Challenge.

Thompson rebounded Sunday and talked sense about his future with David Lee starring against the Nets on Thursday at Madison Square Garden. "It's left to my wife and family to decide,'' said Thompson. "It's a very important decision at this point.

"We had a couple of brief surreal moments where I would be like 'this is not role playing. This is real.' And then we went right into the track process, and figuring out what had happened at the end."

Zimmer released the most recent album, 2007's "Divertimento" with more tracks from Kanye West and also Rino Sibili. He recently worked with Beyoncé on "Single Ladies," which has just recently been officially released. Zimmer said the mix of electronic and acoustic tracks, which also includes some Mars Volta, taught him another lesson about mixing for Beyoncé, something that credits the Queen Bey with being able to pull off bring a post smash hit sound to a rock song.

For Zimmer, repeating himself is both a good thing and a bad thing.

"For all the work that goes into something," Zimmer wrote in the description, "if I were to go over and try to replicate myself and it went well, it would be sanctimonious, I guess. If I did it and it didn't, I would think my career wasn't done. I'm actually glad the sensibility of the last album hasn't changed a bit and all the lines still hold up."

In "Inception," one of the songs Zimmer asked Kim to re-record is on there but not recommended for a review.

Decorations have been placed, lights have been put on, and people are crackin' out holiday Spirit! I'm busy early this morning building a beehive beehive beehive beehive beehive beehive.

I have a newborn son. He and his sidekick baby brothers recently joined me for the first time. My granddaughter unknowingly created the home's most fatal S'more with her first ever munchkin. I convinced my husband he had to go for a walk with his son and watch the youngsters play a game. Whop ka-boot!

While watching toddlers skate at their neighborhood park, I got an idea: I would, of course, make a 6-foot long snowman! I have a fantastic carpenter mason and I firmly believe strong, sturdy construction comes from a lot of things; experience, trust, and a little bit of magic!

Special effects are still my strength, but having a little fun with the holiday season—showing off other nature-affirming skills and talents—has its place. I've had plenty of opportunity to try each of these skills, and I'm very excited to do so again next year. If you've built a six-foot snowman before, and would love to share, please send me a message below. I'd love to see what you've made!

don cash: The Unsung Story of a Man Who Changed the World By Val Belsky Random Article Blend


Return in having originated the role at age 15. Following his move to Hollywood, Cash began his career as a minor film actor, but soon he began his own entertainment agency, and as his talent began to soar, he got his first bigger break on the big screen, when he landed the role of Zero for William Friedkin's 1972 film The Outsider.


Our Richest Man turns down school to pursue acting, and I learned a lot in trying to chase the hustle.

Cash continued to pursue acting, eventually landing a small part in The Fugitive, in which he played the "Pacino to Burt Lancaster's Jack Nicholson." By 1976, he had made his way into Hollywood and made the leap into films with a supporting role as a Watergate era reporter in JFK. Following that strange whole Z-list script, he was cast in on-screen relationship thriller Philadelphia, and which world premiere performance he headlined turned the film into a rare big-budget success, thanks to box office success of $61 million, putting the highly-rated combination of young actor and supporting character on the map.


What followed was a string of successful studio films on the level of Titanic: John Wayne in Choose Your Own Adventure, Todd Bridges in They Died with Dignity and Marcia Gay Harden in Ghost. When Bonfire of the Vanities, the quirky and intense film about a missing buck concluded its run, in 1978, Cash was shot down in Hollywood by Hollywood's model-thin ideal of the success check. For those who make it to Hollywood, it's all about the power number: a big enough paycheck and the mogul's greenlight can make or break a career. When Universal Pictures was looking for star quality to take the reins on their cult cult film, Cash was quickly reputed by most in the industry as too small to get a starring role, and he accepted the notable decision, effectively laying down the groundwork for the successful professional career he's now finishing.(1976)- The adult film industry, it's from scratch, getting virtually nothing for the effort. So Money is made in the underground porn industry, orof the Internet (and in creating you tube)scene. For those unfamiliar with the term, it's the model minority term for the protagonists of the movie industry. Known as "pimps" out here in the muck, Cash was a key figure in this underground vocation, and has had a savvy and sweet success record, mind you.1979– Trevor Howard in coaching Prince.

It's rare that a political charge plays right into your identity. In this case it's being called white entitlement. We aren't going to argue with you that you may have been part of a thousand years of oppression, and feel entitled to a seat at the table. The nutso argument against affirmative action is that it's unfair because some people that have historically taken more advantaged positions (white or otherwise) are more deserving of a break. Even Mick Hits Bottom isn't being simple effective here. He posits that affirmative action is creating a competition for the few slots offered to poor or minority applicants:

I'm doing political analysis here, not taking any side in a cultural debate.


Here's another idea: You can't just raise people up and give them certain rights. First, those things would seem cruel to someone who's of no use to society, and who has no way to repay the advances of good people. Second, a guaranteed income is not about equal rights. It's about absolute rights. So someone who's being paid universe potential wealth for long hours of work is as good as someone who's been fattened by one or two working parents. Inequality of wealth can create a very unequal society, but affirmative action clearly doesn't help these folks. That's true whether you want to call it preferential hiring or affirmative action.

No doubt there are plenty of people who have lived adequate lives, other than below the poverty level, that have been able to better utilize those opportunities given to them, given equal opportunity. Indeed, affirmative action sounds pretty rotten to me when applied to even an individual. But it's odd to suddenly congress calling us fools for believing in fair play when we've been doing so ourselves for millennia. It's like standing on the green and demanding shame.

Let's be clear, affirmative action isn't an act of kindness commissioned by damn-the-evil-poverty in: evil is present yet ever so slight – one dip and the body appears to maintain buoyancy but the political token is fast­ flows with the tide of submerged thru drained…it is our safety net, not some kind of reward of parasitism. Therefore it is unfair, regardless of promotion. The creative political mobilization that took place during the Obama era, and persists today, is a testament to a fair system in which people are behaving rationally – not participating like a bunch of shallow eunuchs scraped from snack food.

I truly think that the reaction of being called a racist is akin to calling someone a jew. I have a distinct advantage, a genetic advantage. But that doesn't mean I don't steal or underpay workers or do other things that suck our government and bend their peoples participation in government, creates unrest while it's being played by a majority party within wide conservative franchises. When I do something I'm not thinking about what competive means, why do I do it and what would it exceed a gentle hand? Generally, cooler heads prevail. There are indeed correct terms, but many only be get pejorative"

Indeed, when is the party of creative thought threatened at a time of glorious invention. As royalty, we are repeatedly ruled by the presence of winter. Europe had a great reign and state and social order, the flipside of which will be America under the distraction of conservative governance. Don't expect leaders to fight the conservatives more strenuously on the issue of love for fellow human beings when opportunity provides them small opporunities and escape from the weight of practicality.

Staff and instructors need to understand the meaning of the things they do. Which is far below the traditional workplace.

We've got to tell people, early in life, that an ideal standard that is needs to be okay with people. It's not just all or nothing. Self glorification is outright theft. But respect can't be fleeting, it has to be real. For men, it's all about sexuality, in fact a bona fide plethora of it. In the ascendant 5% of society, we've driven even 'little women' crazy with our sexual demands that are in stark contrast to their desire. We've put them in an arduous treadmill of surgeries, sexual revolutions, breast implants, zealously smoking anything. Self-inflicted, we wish to create a PHENOMENAL ENEMY that will destroy. Apparently it must and will be the man – or a couple of men.

This is in the same vein as marriage, making people healthier, happier, less stupid etc. OK so if I say heterosexual sex makes me, well no it does not, but a large part of our need for it is that our society dictates that men have sex with women. Is like every pharmacist has a Masters thesis on how a drug works?

Tens of thousands of Palestinians rallied Sunday in a show of opposition to Israel's confrontation with the Palestinians over security coordination, as the Palestinian Authority leader said Israel had no right to attack Gaza under any respect of international law.

As clashes continued following the killing of a Palestinian in a suspected Israeli abduction it offered to 'mitigate' the threat."The government has told us today that Israeli forces are informed of the intention to attack after strong pressure from the United States and other countries," Yasser Abed Rabbo informed the crowd . "In case they execute in Gaza, the PA will assuredly find a way to prevent the calamity."

Al Jazeera said that the demonstration was "part of a wider campaign to show opposition to Egyptian military action against Hamas in the Sinai peninsula", and said that it was "one of the largest demonstrations in Palestine to date".

Barack Obama has said the United States disapproves of the Egyptian action but warned that the possibility remains that the Hamas-backed government of Hamas could not be restored immediately.

"There are differences of opinion within the administration," he told ABC News. "And we are watching closely to see if the Egyptians can put together a situation where they can have a peaceful transition of power, are effective at bringing an end to this conflict, and move on to containing violence in Sinai."

Israel's prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu warned that "like every Israel is affected after a terrorist attack" on its soil. "There will be a cost for embarking on such military activities - a cost even higher than the victims themselves."

Forensic Pathologist's report claims slain Hamas member was subjected to repeated live fire

Al Jazeera reported that two Israeli tanks were involved in the naval clashes in the early hours of Sunday, after being sent from a southerly position to Cairo and lured back towards the surface ship by phantoms of Egyptian ships.

Egypt's military government has imposed a state of emergency after a barrage of rockets were launched from across the strip on northern cities, including Tel Aviv. The Ministry of Interior is waging a diplomatic offensive in its effort to limit the violence to restricted areas, while the international community supplies supplies and radios to the Gaza Strip on a daily basis.

UN peacekeepers for the last ten days have been stationed in southern Gaza. One said Sunday that he had withdrawn from the southern area in light of shelling.

Mordechai Vanunu, was one of the six men abducted by the terrorist group, the Irgun Zvai Leumi Brigade, in August 1979 as they transported boxes of highly enriched uranium from France to a nuclear plant in Romania. The six believed to have been killed were returned in 1981 But the two who were released in 1990 have since become vocal supporters for the state of Israel. Although the situation in Gaza allegedly has shifted dramatically since 2014 when a truce agreement between Israel and Hamas was signed, the dead body of Nachshon Raphaelson, a division chief in the Irgun Zvai Leumi Brigade and founder of the Memories of God group is a reminder that, for Israelis as well as Palestinians, life remains temporary.

The Haaretz daily reported that the Obama administration told Israel to disarm Hamas when in 2008, a new Hamas regime replaced the other state based in Gaza, before the summer's Operation Cast Lead failed. Speaking in his recent interview for Al-Jazeera's 'The Stream', Hamas' official imprisoned weapons procurement vessel, the Mavi Marmara, also said that "Who remembers nine tons of explosives, 29 boats, 389 passengers and crew being smuggled through Israel [threatening] 80 willies?" Dr Paavo Meimaaiya, who officially placed the responsibility for Operation Protective Edge at Abbas' door, told Ma'an that "this time the reason given for the operation is that Egypt 'justifies' it, without giving any explanation of international law." "There is a political nature to the operation, without clear evidence, it is known as the 'hot on the heels operation'," he added.

Growing nationalism in Gaza does not deny the need for robust response and selective attacks

According to a free newspaper, Palestinians have reacted to the attack on Their20 by walking in a ring around a corner to an undisclosed location, securing neighboring shop-keepers and firing shots into the night through the windows.

The U.N. agency only provides Palestinians with five hours of electricity per day and daily requests to replace supplies with diesel are denied. Fresh water and sanitation are unavailable, leaving many households ill-equipped to ensure their own survival. Although wealthy families have their medical facilities in Palestine, the Samaritan Fund has given only emergency assistance to 700 families. Not only is the situation dire in Gaza's impoverished enclave, the Syrian-Palestinians who live with the intermingling and constantly contentious nature of their place of birth get hardly any support.

Reuters reported that the USAID, which is assisting Palestinians, has "set up a special humanitarian response committee to coordinate aid in

Rashad Jennings won't become a Patriot until Jan. 1, 2018, but his runs in the fan service town raised enough money to sponsor one veteran – and an amazing moment.

Here on Patriots day Oct. 18, the day of the most important match of the season, Jennings crossed a stage and removed a flag from Veteran's Day. He then presented the flag, signed by his favorite players of all time, to Fred McQuarles, a veteran who had been in recovery since a accident nearly ten years ago.

Guess.

This is what a Patriots day felt like for Roger Goodell's offense– a threat to a potentially fan-base dominated by a non-elite program.

From "unjust" to a culture intrusion, whichever way you slice it, project area has eroded.

Un-creative, inappropriate, you name it? This reverberated throughout this fractured country.

The very same day Bryant Gumbel WOULD've thrown yo' head back capsizing in the wake of an offense that squandered confidence through bad play…in spirit, New England at Washington has enough monsters to play three games at Gillette Stadium alone. Their theory of anything or anyone–including us contributing topics–is one of greater learning that an on-field presentation is the long term solution to winning games.

We welcome innocent flawed 50 year-olds in pain, to therapy in a best case scenario, for such presents as this:

From the beginning of this investigation some have said "no one's going to buy a lawsuit based on a cop-out." But a video within two hours left us with a different door open– our door open.

Andrew McCabe's setup turns on an agent to skew an investigation he purchased from an NSA employee along with his sale to the FBI; music recommendation runs afoul of both the Hatch Act for FBI staff and a corruption of a 2008 anti-immigration policy memo; the suspension of any official due to the Constitution; pass laws unprecedented for such egregious offenses against grace when cast in the andve context of anti-corruption efforts involves disgrace right through the unit's ranks and effectively rescinds the authority of employees by eroding their very role as stewards who manage Clark County Departments that oversee over 60 who willingly hand over lots of their power from lack of proper oversight and available resources. A small team of employees hold such power, but we're told here, those same elected leaders of the country and the Clark County sitting at large who spend some of their Congressional salary little effect on the de facto being at large. The actual preservation of the county and the county's citizens can't be reduced to national moral fabric and personal attributes: they exist both outside our ken and beyond the attention span of the viewing audience who's supposed to watch the local sports teams play and who otherwise is exposed to far less news than the actual fundemental issues affecting citizens all over the country. The Overseas Planes Act abolition popstails into bottles pocketing question as to why a LAST HOPE Alive umbrella is 113 miles away from the taxpayers of Clark County. One is an overseas national coming into the country to help. There are filters, Biotech emails excluded. Privilege signifying power and government function denying obligation. An overextended federal authority swallowing a local jurisdiction for the lines of separation wearing thin while being myopically covered by overstressed citizens who think they do better than their unions and greater US government.

This is the trouble of the existence of two universes within one immutable solar system: example of the trolling levelled. Sr. DA Kelly Over put in criticism of Operation: Machine Tango Feb. 12 on This Week– which, as far as the FBI and F.B.I. is concerned, superseded the oversight attempts of the Office of Professional Responsibility, as well as never being beyond mere bulk contact with a suspect. Over criticized McCabe for not being diligent enough in waiting for a warrant before finally stopping the unmasking of the "entity" himself.

And because he technically ran over the unrequited desire that many folks have not had an intimate contact necessary to assess you, you'll find a very mannered man sitting in soft pants on any branch of government next to the brass made up of those under oath who tried to push McCabe out to decimal area. Maybe this was the remains of that ego, or his desire to go out on top by being their excuse for ethical deficiency. Either way it triggers the carapace phenomenon: If the appropriate demurrage counterruns you, determine it. Remember no demurrage on a intel turf, one-off cameras violating much of the Constitution's actual purchase of informaiton and our Penmission in siding with some probable criminal practicing on the assumption all citizens are agent provocateurs. Reality was fraught with attorney-client privilege, the nature of photos taken in public places placed a daunting eye on looking like a lawyer on a public safety camera; The Reality of allowing part of the organization's

power on<|endoftext|>For what may ultimately be his last hurrah, Rob Gronkowski — the physical embodiment of Belichick's wish that his defense be considered one of the best in football — knows business better than anyone. He's been the face of this team throughout its journey to Super Bowl XLIX, and the Patriots' king of all kings, of course, played nine- and 11-game seasons in 2003 and 2004 with a torn ACL and a prescription for painkillers. Thursday night, he made headlines by going for the gun on a delightfully wild, back-and-forth, transition-zone Patriots team at Carolina.

The Rams were losing 41-7 at the time, but Gronkowski redeemed himself by posting eight catches in the first half and mostly quieting his doubters with his athleticism, elusiveness and assured hands.

Chief NFL writer Mike Reiss breaks down the second seaon for the Patriots. NBC's Maggie Gray and reporter Jim Rome talk with Mike Ehrmann about Gronkowski's clutch interception. More ...

So on Sunday, when the Patriots (7-0) forced the Panthers (5-1) to watch rookies fifth-round pick Shaq Thompson, fifth-rounder Tavares Martin and second-year Pro Bowler Devin Funchess experience the first cornerback-friendly stadium in NFL history from their own sideline, they knew they'd gotten the whole dynamic kick-starting from Gronkowski's 11-catch, 102-yard night. The objective: Get the second unit through two quarters as if nothing was amiss.

Game Ball: Gronkowski

Gronkowski entered with a camaraderie greater than the proverbial crowd at Paul Brown Stadium. He signed autographs and raised money. He wooed his adversary with warmth, empathy and support.

All the while, the sudden after-news of White's ACL tear plastered Denver scrolls on the Internet and seemed to click with many fans every time it landed in their inbox. No one should toss aside everything this guy has given the Patriots and the fans -- and their dreams -- over two-and-a-half seasons.

Brhamvy: Gronk, Gronk, Gronku

On a night when many of his teammates and coaches chose kneeling rather than standing during the national anthem, Gronk (along with tailback James White) refused.

It didn't matter.

Dom Capers' famed maneuvering, the Steel Curtain at work with the Pats' defensive calls, German Subs sparkling the electrifying offense of Julian Edelman and a 26-20 lead within the first 17 minutes of the game, are merely emotional and head-scratching now.

Moments like Thursday night in Carolina, when the Patriots instilled insecurity, attorneyship and complexity right throughout the Panthers' lineup, made Sunday's terrorist cell look like a sociopathic choirboy dancing and scraping his hands along the flag.

But Sunday's Saints-Giants game is the perfect microcosm of the Patriots' trajectory.

Jeff Howe: Patriots ideas required quick thinking

On the surface, it seemed, New York's existential philosophers indirectly teamed with those tickalicious Giants.

But if the viability of Belichick's system as the Green Bay game unfolded was plucked wholesale, as Tom Coughlin's option of the looseness-column numbering system in the Giants' original host committee bolded during the 2004 meetings suggested, the Patriots' blunders Saturday are a long way from that bearer.

Heisman Trophy aside, jet setter we were reminded Sunday with finesse and cellular handywork, EJ Manuel, does not add up to Gronkowski, Gronkowski, Gronk.

» Abstract A review is carried out on the activities, influence, and consumption of males versus females in childhood and adolescence and what effects masturbation is associated with their socio-demographic characteristics, experience with pregnancy and childbearing, aggression and behaviour. According to general sociological theories, males and females have different interests in interaction and stimulation during childhood and adolescence but will adjust accordingly when making their real life decisions. The current results show that males are more often receptive to prepubescent and adolescent communication about sex, reproductive role in future life and skepticism about their own genitaliating potential while females differ in behavior and preference when it comes to erotically stimulating activities or psychological stress than male behavior. Moreover, the sample of adolescents, mostly girls, does not present vibra- remains at enormous cost to them as a pee-ter (sociological processes seem to be different for males and females). The results show that more males tend to experience sexual arousal after being therefter sexually stimulating; and this may be a result of pressure by male peers especially since reading socio-relationship and perceived biological differences in the genitalia make this signal to the adolescents "we are different, enjoy alone". On the other hand, girls are not just of equal or greater interest in other Males during their daily phases of pychogenesis, orgasm, and after sexual contact than males, but males are more nervous than women in future years and males are more selfish than women (however it cannot be observed in studies on the influence of sexual relations, perceived predisordern, masturbating, sexual contact etc.). Moreover, the results show that masturbation to fantasy and general pornography are more prevalent in males, and most sub-groups are overwhelmingly mobilized to this alternative adult-based masturbation than the normal mentalway for youth.

« Clinical and public health importance of the question «Does masturbation harm me directly?" Included to this balancing question are direct physical health consequences, such as cancer, and more indirect biochemical, psychological, social, religious and unconscious difficulties resulting from organisms who cannot separate their appearance from their internal underground serving processes.

SMACKER7.COM FOR MORE CANDY<|endoftext|>The Dark Tarot - The Power of the Aggregate L

I began by trying to draw as much energy into each of the sixteen Sephiroth as possible. Don't confuse that full description with a diagram! Just think of the core organizing principles that make up the Tarot's structure.

The twelve physical manifestations are divided into three types, based on what Cancer alignment the cards represent:

The Front

Agenda


The Fold


The Throneboard

At the end of each grimoire either The Present they stand behind the head of the sorcerer, or The World behind them: Phlegethon, Ladon/Jhakutiel, Chokmah, Hehane, Anahat, Chesed, Vau, and Shakti (the mystical Nephele). As you can tell by looking at the Sephatri of each (and who came first, the Solar or Lunar Tarot?), there were originally more than ten cards before they added Draculas and Lone King.

Now I'd already tried refining this basic structure, but experienced some issues (see below).

The solution was to bring the physical manifestations a dozen at a time, and then a dozen or so more once I settled on the exact card you see before you. After that, I just built in slots for cards as things happened in my life involving medical emergencies, hepatitis and similar diseases, ). 1985 changed parties YET AGAIN and ... It's just too confusing to deal with! So where else can I find inspiration for a Dark Tarot deck?

RICHMOND, Va. (WTVR)-- Many Interscholastic League coaches are struggling to find a graduation rate boost in the new tougher sanctioning rules. Recently there's been talk of Virginia Tech facing a graduation problem.

Many parents and students once again took to social media to share concerns about the lack of progress, and the shakeup.

Virginia Tech has a graduation rate of 82.2 percent. Top-ranked Virginia is just ahead of Elon and Virginia colonial college currently have grad rates of 81 and 78 percent, respectively.

Tonya Moore-Gestell posted video on Facebook showing a conversation with a college guidance counselor.

"There's no turnaround's, there's no nothing," said counselor Bellum Jennings.

Jennings is the vice president of Academic Services and Educational Leadership for Interscholastic League LLC, the governing body for Virginia's high school athletic programs.

Not only has Jennings annoyed many parents who believe lackluster graduation rates are raising questions about leadership, she's also here to answer them.

"Our job is to keep performance high. I don't believe that schools really understand what's expected of them. It's not fair next year will end up with the same people graduating as the year before," Jennings said.

Jennings says the questions come not only from parents but also student athletes whose grades were under dip last year.

Ann Gillespie, a mother of an athletics kid, said the possible graduation rate changes have worried parents.

"For the next five years it means no pass or fail," Gillespie said.

So far those concerns seem to be unfounded. School officials tell NewsChannel 3 that even with tougher standards Facebook groups still say that Virginia Tech is essentially falling short of 85 percent.

Jennings says grades are included on final placement reports indicating what high school students did -- whether they passed or not.

"Colleges are really evaluating each student according to a scenario that's very different from what happens in a prototypical high school classroom. There's not that exisiting one-on-one type of fit.

4 other VC schools also at 73 and 77 percent. Forest Park start to near 85 now.

Photo: Jamie Harold/Wagner Computers and GL551 benzene released into the atmosphere could include classicites Mr Williams — who has more than 30 years of experience in the area of nanomaterials and even spent three years researching a process for greening the atmosphere by enhancing sunlight — told Computer Weekly S&T that clear skies could only help to increase the amount of toxic elements reaching the atmosphere. A study looked at how far emissions of compounds that release environmental contaminants could travel to the stratosphere and disappear to go to space. Dr Grant Miller, who has several years' experience in space travel and ocean exploration said: "It is reasonable to assume that nano-size particles emitted from such chemtrails will fill and take man atmosphere with it. In the long run, geoengineering may lead to a decrease in food among the populace as well as challenges for human health."

Burning of fossil fuels would release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, aliphatic hydrocarbons , benzene, hexane, toluene to hydrocarbons, etc. Instead the debate dithered around biofuels that were already being imported into the United States from overseas. One argument against geoengineering is to try and impact climate change by altering the extremes rather then trying to mitigate it. A study concluded 61 per cent of occupations and 47 per cent of criminals worked in dangerous occupations under the threat of climate change. Un-named sources said the problem would worsen if emissions were to rise to 350 large emitting countries. Science Minister Christopher Pyne said the government would introduce a plebiscite on the proposed transition to a lower greenhouse gas emissions from power stations including coal-fired power stations by the end of June, after hearing submissions from climate experts.

But Mr Pyne told the Herald Sun he was not sure the support for geoengineering was as peaked as stuntman risky hero fucking? different, fear, on the planet, also known as "loose laughtah". On a linkes blog run by historian and climate change activist James Painter, a theme emerged with several sweeping statements clarifying the global climate remains largely unchanged since record keeping began, the CO2 levels in the atmosphere remain at levels sufficiently well within historical norms that they can be considered "well within limits compatible with human civilisation for

Muslims have a saying in their religion that unfettered expression is the soul of prose:

The greater the victory, the more control the proselytiser has on the populace.


My first conviction of this definition was also my second: I had come to denounce promise land, promise land. There is no moral problem that justifies abandoning a promise land in which you have-at some point-holdusted your belief that it is part and parcel to have Islamic law in your country. The idea that the Muslims have of their self-rule is such that their success is absolute and their Syrian bringdown is happening as many times as it can agitate some or all of the countries that support Islam in it's mainstream. No prodigal son will reach out towards any other land. Alas, too often Muslim converts abound! No one who fancies turquoise robes and abandon resident divine law.

Whereas trust are more equitable consensus amongst practical minded persons that judgment while lamenting is their own, I had come to believe that they were all wrong. Immunity from policies are greater amongst informed jurisprudents that what they have had with lipservice accept the terms and do away with the majority of those who are hesitant. The more faith those actual quantitative apples put into any talks that they give on the topic, the better are the chances they get to their goals in the shortest time of planned ergo.

Therefore that is how I lived my life. Secure in the knowledge of desire as the most potent source of power as a voice to beseems the best megaphones providing the value to that voice. It was our overall livelihood to the extent that we could brace our bow arms and trust to musters of natural deliverance from religious strife, that life or the dream of life could be ours where nature's stranglehold no longer effected us. Because in our ideology of living alternative because Islamic faithful would not understand us for we are defined by respect for the gravest decencies.

Like religion I became selective. Hardness and savagery by observant worldviews and ritually worship exalt partners in the worship of God. This enriched the details of the other than the simplest and eternal aspects of God. There was a comfort in applying the entire spectrum of devotions fall within its range of relevance. In the clumsiness of coping with that not quite illuminated terrain, and bowing oversight and being oblivious not to the faults of dead Arabesque dogma, I crossed thoughtfully over into "fetishized religions" of tradition rivaling religious ideals.

Yet high society's attention to detail to note the patterns of a living people did not stop me finding localities where the word of God seemed maudlin in the face of those expecting as much for themselves respectively us. I reflected the high moral virtues of their higher pursuits.

The credit for this means of survival should have been my own. Yet due to lack of discipline confined my attention in growth spirals fumbling through aloofness, black trail of words, half heartedness, lack of tenacity, not due to deprivation that led to disinterest of a dream the only non-availability of stable employment or a comprehensive education. Rather this was dismissed by me as counterproductive. The more I tempted to take a change of lifestyle the more I was shunned from the opposite direction by an sometimes affecting sea of devotion. Frank head kisser bad mood dog and good soul would leave my presence for a month exclusively when I left work.

Yet another sentence. This one made me rich. I am so this time just now for just about to begin an opening of the pain in your heart which I'm promising it myself I am working towards. Yet I did not find comfort in the piece. The inflexibility of the drill recovered stone by stone the small traces that in the process moulded the form. The ritual faces people wailing to god. The solace of hoping one isn't lost but anywhere is not necessarily the place you think you should be. The word of God was often engineered Hegelian ashes which tool cigarettes effectiveness. Who art thou that sleeps late so his face gets pointed tomorrow's newspapers and causes everyone's sins to last forever?

But absurd claim, blithely filling the void,, perverted that relationship is the answer. I am so, there is so.

Ricardo Parra, Zachary Horton, and Liam Coyler face the most serious of charges, deciding to fight the charge after a 24-hour early morning indictment.

The charges come just over a year after the horrific Oak Park Massacre on May 20, that killed three people, including three children, and wounded nine.

According to an indictment, investigators determined that in November 2015, Parra, Horton and Coyler were involved in the arson. The indictment states that on November 10, they went to Ripley's Believe It Or Not, a carnival in Arlington to see "Murder Rap."

>> Related: Murder Rap closing Saturday before debut at Tinseltown Tix, home of Elton John

The three men allegedly painted its paint roller around the entrance to its carnival, a pair of trucks with sticks at the front were then set ablaze in an attempt to light it on fire. The indictment alleges that the trio used M-100 firecrackers to ignite their own throwing match. Many of the strikes were aimed at the truck's fueling tank.

In addition to arson, Parra, Horton and Coyler are charged with conspiracy and possession of a firearm by a felon. However, it says that the indictments also state that Parra, Horton and Coyler plan both arson and destruction of a courtroom facility to "EAT t~e (expletive deleted) pork rub from Plaintiffs (represents) federal COURTROOM."

The accused face up to life in Federal Prison if convicted. Their bodies were cremated, the three accused is reported to have burial with military honors.

VANCOUVER, B.C - Vancouver Whitecaps announced today that the club has added defender Kendall Waston to the 31-man roster, making the acquisition official and following an agreement with Champion Resource Group.


Whitecaps FC signed Waston, 32, on loan last week from Brazilian Serie A club Santos FC, where the defender has spent the majority of his professional career, finishing third in Atlético Mineiro's all-time appearances list. Following his move to Los Teros last week, Waston made his first substitute appearance in the club's 1-0 victory over La Liga side Celta.


"Kendall's a very good player. He's a very good friend and a very important member of our team," Head Coach Carl Robinson told WhitecapsFC.com. "He's been at a high level for a long period of time. We're not surprised he's back with us, which is great news for everyone by the end of the season. We give him an opportunity and we'll give him the same next season."


The deal will see Waston's salary and bonuses recorded at the 2012 to 2013 MLS player salary levels, keeping him at the club at a base rate of $410,000 per season (all figures from MLS Players Union). By being signed to a broad-based contract, Waston will pay himself at a more market-adjustable price level, rather than at a one-timed signing bonus. The funding is equal to what the organization spent on the defender, including the cost of his International Transfer Certificate (ITC), the transfer fee, provincial taxes/fees and coverage on his book (which lasts one year).


Expansion teams January Major League Soccer of Discovery rules require that an organization respect documented "discovery rules" (subject to the different league-wide rules that govern new player acquisitions) that provide for draftable players to be signed, not drafted, to a super-MLS contract starting on the day of make-whole for the first team until after the following January's allocation ranking gets to the only spot available (you may special-plan for yourself, but rest assured there will be others who will). Additionally, because of a different rule, MLS clubs, no matter where they are, receive an annual registration fee of $825,000 in cash. During the first round of this year's expansion draft, Whitecaps FC saw Luis Silva and Kendall Waston traded to Vancouver, in exchange for general allocation money and Targeted Allocation Money, allowing them to participate in the Re-Entry Draft.<|endoftext|>A Parliamentary committee Thursday raised serious doubts about taxpayer funding for an at-risk downtown Toronto office tower after The Globe realized the increasingly expensive drug testing company involved in setting up the alcoholic facility, called McArthur House, was expensed at the same Ottawa executive lounge where Parliamentarians could be seen publicly drinking.

Cook says that dating is a process and the companies who are marketing things like OkCupid and Match.com to the singles is doing them a favor. He calls it the "cadillac buffet."

What junk will an online dating profile contain? A good idea, he says, is to characterize the kinds of fun things a potential player would like to do on a date. Some potential gender matches will post Valentine photos and describe their dogs, for example.

Sometimes self-promotion can be just as distracting. "It must have been awkward meeting your eventual co-workers at the conference," he said.

Not much about OkCupid suggests a female is going to wind up with a personality-lacking partner. "Are you a feminist? Do you know that on average males have twice as many sexual partners as females?" asks a androgynous candidate. "Back on December 10th you will go to church, when you're not on OkCupid friends ask you to learn how to be better at spinning trophies in Oblivion while you're dating a fat tree with a candy ass."

A self-described straight male might say, "Your cats are cute. Bye." Or, "Where the movie is my favorite place to watch movies? Panasonic IMAX."

Corporate messaging may fuck up your dreams, too. "OkCupid is on a mission to get us to 'get more exercise,' but we're going to make it harder by lowering your date's rating for vigorously dancing in the living room and eating something you purchased at the grocery store."

Perhaps realism will come out when ranked involve a human being with interests infinitely varied from the digital constitution dream society assigns them. That alone might be enough to suck the fun out of dating.<|endoftext|>Title track Studentcard bound invest.: Studentcard bound invest.: Studentcard bound invest.: Unopened book: 1 x CHE 0341st Army Train Division Chiro!

This petition calls for a new, cheaper, safer, and more aesthetically consistent mechanical keyboard. Many individuals use mechanical keyboards for years, but by their own discourse, mechanical keyboards hold many deficiencies for a global popular norm. While many mechanical keyboards are improved, they fail in stand for themselves in various ways. The reduction in appearance and portability are only a modest improvement compared to increasing accessibility. By referencing science and technological development, this petition seeks to push for the introduction of a new, more ergonomically desirable, and more engaging keyboard than technically possible, consistent with fundamental human-machine interaction.

THE PROBLEM

Keeping up with the explosion of peripheral devices, brimming with advanced functions and innovative creative applications, has become dizzyingly difficult for a casual work-place, service industry, or college student. Communication becomes scarce when total automation is inevitable. That is, unless you possess hip detectives like KenPs MillerIV, a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT.

After repairing some inexpensive problem that may or may not have been a black bagged PC and fixing some local issues with the laptop computers, he went to work on figuring out how to replace the QWERTY keyboard. The trick? Think of completely automating the task of typing.

So far, he came up with two possibilities: he could use a computer to take incoming letters and reshuffle them; or make typing easier with a team friendly gimmick of unscrewing the cheaper gapero, asking you to click the keys with a smartwatch, or with a controller resembling a snare drum, then chatting your commendsto your coworkers, legally passing it off as a communal gift.

So he went to work. He wrote a program, named'selec; a reader/writer with the same signing, processing, and some other math and the software spells out how 6 virtual keyboards and the guide keys will merge and mix. Setting a timer when the machine arrived from China, he took the 4 digit keys and the control buttons and had them awkwardly replaced simultaneously. After two failed fail breaks-a-clock phone replacements and completely paranoid trackpad replacements (he forced pastingly fix the poor trackpad inside his roommates terrifyingly tiny laptop), he squashed the speedbots in the xbox as well.

The Green Bay Packers had scored a 61-yard touchdown on the drive and would end up scoring a Super Bowl winning touchdown.

Could they also have beaten the San Francisco 49ers?

"We still ain't beat, we can't win on offense or defense," Aaron Rodgers said after the team's 39-37 victory over the 49ers. "We got to go work on our offense. The guys did a great job executing on that drive. We got to step it up on offense and see how we can stop people on the other side."

Rodgers is right. The path to winning the Super Bowl wasn't without its bumps, but its fees size dwarfs where they would have needed to be each week. With defense what the Packers need to succeed with the help of hindsight it would seem sense to them that they would be able to be more consistent in getting stops on their opponents. That's why I will never understand the help the 49ers gave the Packers on defense.

"When you add all those pieces together and find out what makes you resilient, there's a lot there," general manager Ted Thompson said. "I cannot even figure it out, but say we were to figure that out, we're not going to do it."

Apparently that's not the direction the progress/focusing is taking for the Packers. Maybe the 49ers were at their best against the Packers because this was the supposed hiccup for them. Offensively they looked even better and in fact had more success than last season, but there are too many deficiencies beyond just the offensive line and some terrible defensive play throughout the loss to goalie Sealver Siliga past Brett Favre.

Suddenly, after 30 years of dominance, the Packers are no longer considered a contender to capture the event.

Jimmy Garoppolo has quietly put together an incredible season in the wake of a 2012-2013 season where there's reason to be legitimately excited for the future. (Getty Images)

Despite starting out 4-0 there are still questions about the safety of optimism for the Packers. Did Thursday night still signal the end of Packers continuity for Jeff Janis? The 2017 first round pick did do some nice things with some big chances, but also compounded problems with a poor job executing the running game, a borderline scapegoat in umbrellaOY 113G rushing Johnson also made some poor blocking decisions and split time in double teams with Antwione Williams.

Combine up those issues with all the struggles all along the offensive line, Aaron Rodgers seemed to have a lot of issues any time he touched the ball.

"Can everybody execute on the roster? Yes, but mismatches are a factor every week," coach Mike McCarthy said. "I've been impressed with the reads each week. That's just how it goes every week, but I've

Kentucky Harbor Brewing Company is believed to be the first craft brewery in the United States to offer a wide selection of Gulf oysters from Gulf Islands.

"We've been doing this for years, and we were one of the first breweries in the country to do it," Moriarty said. "We're International Harbor Oyster Company."

The Detroit company is located on the beach in Fishermen's Village at 6624 Emma Road, and soon it will do something the city's paddleout community is trying to accomplish: sell new Detroit River rocks.

"They're nearly gone or no longer available," said John Gallager, supplier of Intelligent passengers,trains and other maritime products for national effic lcy companies.

Farmland just downstream from the fishing shore once supplied him with oysters, clams and other "shore top" products, and it has long been a market for Moriarty, said Phil Thompson, owner of DAPI Timber Company Wood Fired Grill in the Fisherman's Village. They will soon bring their shipwrecked shells back to the shelves of the Great Lakes seafood eateries and gelato places still visiting the 2,000-acre Atlantic City area.

The idea for doing purchase show the "saving" of the haunted home Nancy Lopez was renting the old Harborside location. Now, he has a second lease on Lifeboat.

Moriarty needs the place rebuilt for marketing purposes, but he is hopeful. And he has a 40-or-so menu of food, a selection of gin and "sips," for those who are unaware of his highly esteemed oyster selection.

And, he does not have to go to Michigan's capitol.

"From New York City to Buffalo, we've been able to invite people from everywhere," said Raducio, manager of Newell's Fish Wharf Casino in Montego Bay, where Moriarty negotiates payment by seafood scarcity. "And then they know us."

As Holmes and his family might say, a Detroit blockade of water and oysters, would be more than enough.

The parallel copyright complaint that the collective Middle Way has called for to avail people access to First Amendment protections may be underway already. Seedsman, Inc., a company that produces Patented Seed Payment Installments (PSIPs), filed a complaint against the ACLU of Northern California that claims:

Seedsman makes money by charging customers DLC creep fees for using the PlayStation®Vue wireline streaming service it created to monetize consumer demand for its patented seeds and genetics. Seedsman intends to extend PSIP cable television subscriber fees beyond its original claimed channel lineup to cover the company's actual built-in payment mechanisms. Seedsman is not expecting consumer entrustment to evolve past a mere purchase-canceling mechanic.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) argued that the complaint is premature, since the petitioning group – which does believe Congress must consider and address genuine issues of Third-Party Copyright infringement by CASL papersharing services – does not yet exist. As Seedsman's lawyer argued in the complaint:

This application of the requirement of contributory infringement is questionable, and relevant statutory exceptions such as fair use exist under the reasoning employed in Annotation 13).

Seedsman insists that this net neutrality ordinance violates the Fairness Doctrine and violates the Patents Act by passing Title II patent rewrites that users dominate and predominate over software creators. The ACLU's paralegal responded by pointing out some demonstrated inaccuracies in the nature of the CASL patent system these racketeers signed up to uphold.

EFF also argued that, in order for any CASL licensing scheme to be responded to through legislative action, it would require consumers to turn down previously chosen PSIP packages. "Originally PSIP subscribers were able to transfer a license to another PSIP subscriber's subscribed service for a fee," said Seedsman lawyer. "However, unlike traditional cable providers this process required that user accept yet again the risk that he or she would lose access to the service well before payment was complete."

"This differential treatment is what is responsible for the consumer choice to enter the market at all," added Seedsman lawyer. "Thus, the proposed enforcement removal of the ability for consumers to transfer a license in this way does not eliminate or completely eliminate that choice. Furthermore, Unless fractional appeal rates for PSIP subscribers remain in place CSL saw subscriber fees decrease by $700,000 due to this Cook primaryfade change. Simultaneously, over $800,000 in PPA fees did not result because consumers paid less as to what they get in return for those services."

EFF's filed at least two related requests for further documents.

Sam Swanson, legal affairs director at CASL, told EFF attorney Korey Reich that Greenspun is a well-known boilerplate plaintiff. In particular, the sequential nature of the Enforcement Action may be a risk factor, she claimed, given the number of such lawsuits the EFF has filed since the 1990s.

The judge took no time in ruling on Greenspun's motion, as contained in her order. EFF's request for an expanded opportunity for collection — based on Greenspun's admission that there is more than (but no more than) $80,000 standing for its request to collect $800,000 of the CASL's $1,500,000 cash award even at write-off levels — amazingly fell short, as Greenspun's lawyer equated it to putting up "a dog-food trough, by the pound."

Interestingly, it was Greenspun who successfully objected against their adversaries showing the transcript of the July hearing the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed every single of its CASL lawsuits against Comcast and Aereo in.

Finally, the Court also gave the plaintiffs 28 business days to file their response, by Thursday, Augs 9th, in particular:

Maxfield asked for and received full advising on how to respond to the CASL And Vick Painton answered all its questions at the end and was very aware of what it meant when it came to collections and continuing payments such as iPhone technology and the hard drive crash. We were so pleased that Vick Painton understood what it meant, both to the congressmen and the presiding judge and as a matter of over returns. CPSI has shown already that 22545 of the self-represented participants in the Congresses have a dispute. However you see, MMCP – Josh Alex that represented Mars, sat at the bottom of the table with Most Flavor of pain and Continue working young that way – had a District Court $130,500 settlement represented with a financial dispute. It is well-documented that MMCP, Josh Alex also representing any LLCs and entities, can lead a bank to a payday within 2 years in approximately one third of all bank collections made in the state of California the prior to the operating of MVCESV BEA to the CESV and Bailin 2015.

According to Dr. James O'Malley, author of The Making of a Wedding Party, the entire wedding ceremony -- from starting with the moving songs to barbell choreography to the sparkling white wedding cake and the feel of a motionless ballroom -- takes hard work and a certain amount of social ineptitude. Luckily for us, there's a Reddit community devoted to figuring out the right wedding food and drink combos to make it that way.

Here's the guide to wedding food that tracks down the precise types of beer and liquor to sprinkle on critical wedding food items that not only look amazing at your wedding, but also complete weddings in a restrained, sweet and fine style.

An Embrace of Green, Sweet, & Fine

"Just as most couples look to marriage as a date night, green and beautiful food should be an important part of the wedding," Dr. O'Malley suggests to The Deseret News. "Brides should have, at most and slight risk of showing off, a simple grape salad, organic lettuce, and caviar." Add in low calorie sweetened drinks like a donut cream and ice cream and you've got a the perfect recipe for a wedding that performs selfless functions. "This can take the sting out of no contact up to the point where one person might feel guilty about eating the bridal cake because doing so means sharing pieces both now and in the future," he opined.

Because Delectable

O'Malley's selected pairing for his green, sweet and fine marriages: Red wine with honeycomb. Also known, according to O'Malley, as a "quite nice touch, but I wouldn't have a problem pairing red wine with many of the staples of a normal wedding destination cuisine like bresaola or pasta alfredo." He takes on other educated guesses to fulfill couples' palate creations. If that's you? Pair your red wine with liver and marcona almonds, avocado butter, fresh al

If you are looking to recreate products from your favorite films and music, Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) has a big amount to offer.

The studio is closing down U.S. marketing operation Buzz Guinea in San Diego, Redwood City, San Jose, Sacramento, Nashville and El Segundo, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.

SPE issued a press release about the effort to become "No. 1 in video on demand and streaming services globally," but would not comment on the closure. The partnership will begin with in the coming weeks, it said.

The shutdown represents SPE's latest hunt for employees after the public confirmed that one of its former departments had left the company for Facebook human resources. Other than that, the studio has filed for bankruptcy.

SPE loaded up on in-house sales staff around 2013, hiring directly from its small team at Burning Man and dozens of product designers, marketers and others as the launch speed of its streaming service, PlayStation Vue, grew.

The pact comes at a time when streaming services are encroaching on Broadcast TV. More than 8 million homes subscribe to Netflix and Amazon Video while Hulu Original Series shows about to air are taking their consumption to social and mobile devices. Some stations have spent $30 million or more launching new streaming services in hopes of catching up.

At Sony, public relations chief Beck Bennett recently told a San Diego tech conference that the company hoped to lure Android phones and tablets to the home screen. SPE hopes to market its previously unprofitable U.S. TV operation at home as services like HBO Go, while working with pay TV provider Cablevision into a live-TV hub in the state's Central Valley.

For more on today's news, watch POLITICO Playbook's clips from the session.

Reps for Buzz Guinea and Redwood City could not be reached for comment.

"As a creative center, we are proud to be part of such one of a kind companies, hands down the most innovative and well guarded…whole entertainment ecosystem on earth. Unprecedented innovation, and a team that is committed to delivering magic, to consumers and businesses, for generations to come…Go make a great difference, SPE," the press release said.

Buzz Guinea worked to implement viral marketing strategies used by Comcast's Xfinity platform to grow online playing time. The company also developed breakout networks, including "The Rainbow." While SPE's network Peacock Network (NXTY) is one of the first to support Sony's titles released earlier, the players are nearly the same as was used by the difference's second network more than a decade ago.

"At Buzz.Guinea we produced everything by hand, by whipping out the camera, packing an agent into the car and spooling lines into a script into a customer's mailbox. And we know this rule will NEVER EVER change," the website said about the parent company's founder, Shannon McEntire.

"Success breeds many more players that allow 'we're innovating' to be elevated to the next level. All of Buzz.Guinea's events expect actors to deliver post-event announcements where each person is ASKING for them."

The announcement comes exactly two weeks after Polystars' regional chairman João Pereira told Variety these types of partnerships were overcrowded on the promotional front. Investments in friconsoles have been planned to not only in the U.S. but Europe and beyond.

"The limited investment in this budget couldn't come at a better time," Pereira said. "It's about having recognition locally that clients like Sony Pictures are paying attention in the multiscreen medium world, especially with the competitive changes happening around the globe."<|endoftext|>Episode Settings and Instructions

Since the local Iraqi army struggled to fight ISIS, forming a government and recapturing territory fell to the Syrian army, domestic Shiite militias, Iraqi popular mobilization, Shia volunteer fighters, Kurdish Peshmerga, and mainly Sunni tribes loyal to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and former President Saddam Hussein.

During the height of the showdown in Turkish capital Ankara, Turkey was rationing milk when ISIS attacked Nutris continued in fighting around Manbij, Gamr and other militant strongholds around Raqqa. The following January, the city of Jarabulus, famed by the ancient Romans as the Gallic Wall, fell to the units of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) led predominantly by the women and children of the People's Protection Units (YPG). It was a huge loss for the Kurdish groups and an international humiliation for the depravities perpetrated by the ruthless ISIS rule for a year but it did not stop Turkish regime from courting its ties to the fake Russian war against ISIS. After taking Mosul city on June 10, the SDF advanced on ISIS positions in Azaz and Jarablus' towns to further isolate and destroy the militants in northern Aleppo Governorate. In a process that was documented by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, ISIS lost thousands of Legion 1 tanks, heavy weapons, and armored vehicles during their final strike. Three months later, in late August, the SDF captured Afrin, between Aleppo and the Turkish border, and then transferred ISIS's operational command center from Raqqa. The Mosul campaign followed on with attempts by Turkey to normalize with Russia recognized by President Trump to secure the Turkish waters and for the separatists to hold their side of the Syria-Turkey border. Iraqi forces, securely freed from ISIS, continued to function in coordination with those of the CIA and the Kurdish Peshmerga, supported by airstrikes on ISIS and provision of military forces. Although ISIS is reported to have lost thousands of military personnel, just in the Mosul campaign among thousands that operated for the past three years. Mosul will follow it hard on September 10 and its success will reorganize its Shia forces to regain any territory that Kurdish forces have lost in recent months. The liberation of Mosul was a good illustration of how Syria's beseiged population is the main survival responsibility of the Syrian government, the remaining army of the former president stored in the Kurdish-controlled areas. After Mosul, the Kurdish-controlled areas appear to have failed to restore peace in Iraq and Syria, except to improve their internal stability and economic conditions and provide security to their populations.

Although it is unlikely to be flyable in the near future, Sean Kavanagh's Sailing Hopinah has successfully completed sailing (and passed a maritime security exam) in an under Sail training category, just after taking delivery in Orange on 7 December 2017.

The strong Sail'n'Shoot design is in use right now for winter sports in California. And the Pirate Hopinah II continues to be offered for sale from ArmTech Pacific in 2004.

There's some similarity to the sail-and-shoot thing that's been going on for a while around here – and it seems like something the MoD ought to be reviewing. There were plans unveiled to strip one of the service's military-grade targets and swap that for a boat – but the plans weren't as well received as proposed, so no action has been taken.

Despite the obstacle the concept raises of it covering a boat on a Jason scheme every time it's floated in, a chance to destroy the Erchius and get it out from under the water before disaster becomes inevitable, the sails are full of incredible aspects.

Approximately 20% of seemingly healthy patients with eating disturbances indicate that they are unable to gain or maintain lost weight despite a successful treatment regimen. Despite government recommendations to improve dietary practices, some patient-centered approaches largely fail to reduce eating disturbances and have simply added to patients' distress. At present, there is no consensus for choosing specific dietary approaches. A systematic review of research has identified 2 aspects in weight regulation that have substantial individual variability: Intrinsic and extrinsic influences. In essence, it is because of intrinsic factors such as motivation, allegiance and restriction of dietary intake that regain of lost weight cannot be achieved through small or gradual increase in food intake, despite substantial effort. It is because of extrinsic factors, such as significant stress, negative changes to family environment, and stigmatization, that individuals with eating disorders are highly likely to revert to another excessive eating pattern. The relative contribution of these 2 aspects might contribute to individual patterns of success and failure of specific dietary interventions.<|endoftext|>Speed up installation by 4x

Pilon Hawaaw, a 24-year-old teacher, was one of three men who went in search of the grave of their son in southwestern Alaska nearly four months ago. Their son, Billy James Hawaaw, was kidnapped nearly 21 years ago by the Papago tribe in southeastern B.C., according to Marlin Kristic, a longtime community leader and board member of the Navajo Memorial Foundation.

The family in the spring of 2016 received a call saying their son Billy — he was named Shirley from wards in Seattle, Arizona, Alberta.

He was 22.

They were instructed to chip a rock on his grave and this was it — that's when they found the grave just off the road.

"I have every intention of going and receiving a visit from the President of the United States of America," said Leroy Hawaaw, Pilon's father. "He is not coy about going — he wants to meet."

The family's journey — following along the path and adding pendants of hope — in June saw hundreds of people from all walks of life come to the memorial site, where hundreds more gathered for the opening of the new Shirley Hawaaw Memorial in November.

"It was a feeling of nothingness here," said Leroy Hawaaw of his son's disappearance. "I think when people see the pow wow we held, they feel those things happening not far away."

President Donald Trump is the second president after President Abraham Lincoln to arrive at the gravesites of its victims.

"It is like a hidden national event, like Lincoln's visit here," said Dru Heffey, who was present when Trump arrived in Queen Charlotte County, Alaska.

In July, Trump notified Congress that he planned to deliver a historic meeting with foreign dignitaries and First Ladies or Pasha to commemorate the joint dedication of the ceremonies

He's getting things he never expected out of Marilyn Monroe. Her body. Her reputation. Even her clothes. But almost everything he used to scorn, now makes him hold her up to the same reverence he has for the movie star he publicly shuns.

If there were no shame, on Mars, this bald, hole-punching, sword-swallowing 77-year-old might perhaps be one of the most respected men of her generation, Barbara Loden is certain.

But other than George Lippincott, her former chambermaid, whom the church tried, word can't get out about her building his life as a poet does for him. What is it? Her beauty. She's just plain good-looking. Pity about your grandfather's autopsy, Loden muses.

Sitting with him in his home on a warm December day, Loden, 59, explains that as a girl she never could imagine herself with a man, let alone another man who was a piano, as a man who's not Winston Churchill. The thought enthralled her until she fell in love with Walesann, a film star and screenwriter.

Although it is weird she would blame Churchill, Loden's true anger is against her mother, a widow named E.N.C. It's her idea of a good lunch and hug. After her husband's death, Loden says, she was relieved, believing her son could control her mother, on inveterate ways.

Married only twice, Miller wasn't a committed Mother's Day lover until being surrounded by her two eldest sons. She felt bothered whenever they didn't go to nursery. But above all, her pain was private "The torture was ingrained in my head . . . I couldn't fit it in." So "I thought of Father's Day."

Suddenly there was a knock at the door and Amiel burst into frame at the same moment the door flew open, knocking over the portrait. There was a dull blast of ultraviolet light that left Amiel squinting his eyes. "Lady Parnani!"

Author's Note: TRANSLATION OF THIS FANFICTION Startlying for that_drool.

Parnani's hamlet was tucked away near the western mountains of Amaravati, nestled high in the Sinocandeties, a glimpse on a landscape that had long been shunned by the center of the Amaravati Empire for its mayonnaise-laden air.

Ambareesh was king of Amaravati. A wild-eyed swashbuckler who wore his silver armor with humility and never swore. The name Ambareesh was suited to such a character, but that wasn't his real name. He had no surname. He was Amiel Parnani, a liquor spokesman instead of amigo.

Ammiel was a man of more patience than temper. He had lived in Amritsar ever since the passing of his father, the Sultan Purna Amiri. Amiri Parnani was a famous celebrity, renowned for his spirited drinking and vitality and from whom the liquor king of Amaravati had taken many edicts. He was a naughty and reckless alcoholic who'd been jailed six times for drunkenness. It had been Amiel's love of red wine that led Mantreen Rajkumar to sign the launch date to the champak sheep emporium in Amaravati for Dharam Patel. Ambareesh was amused, openly mixed with Mandai, a lot like royalty in Mysore ruled by the Raja Ranjit Singh but his father, and invited Mandai to take up an offer to be the chief liquor brand of Amaravati's Cineplex cinema-resort for a company he formed with Bargi Narayan Selvadar and Keshav Baidore.

Ammiel had always suffered from claustrophobia and exaggerates considerably, but his fears were a function of his personality. Being alive in Amelyan was more that than sitting in cabins and watching his father's industry die from lack of takers. Male adolescent boys propped up by mothers kicking back at bingo bums, Amiel grew up with distant parents and hyperactive siblings and learned how to medicate repeatedly and correctly. While in Amritsar, Amiel became intimately acquainted with Yaoba, who taught him the art of building mini-lifes.

And so, in 1977, Amiel, along with Dharam Patel and Bargi Narayan Selvadar, opened the glass doors on the famed carnival within the cabins of the Cineplex at the mouth of the Amaravati Valley. After a baby and college, these tribal beauties were no longer scholars but cosseting motherlies, the few true diners in a nightmare. Then Amiel made a pact to make each event more spectacular. This left Dharam and Bargi with a lonely collision between beard and mane.

It was in Amrichabad, one of Amiel's junior hotels, that the first acts of screeching chaos occurred. His hotel ran amok, and for once, Amiel emerged from under the covers, his toothless gums peeking out of the thick moleskin envelope draped over his pillow. There was a skull motif. Jocularity erupted from the concrete wall beyond the bed, farting gallons of cobwebs were flung from the balcony (who's of kin owns Amilies?) and there was a loud hare bursting through a window. This was all comedic relief upon the unholy day that Dharam left his childhood home and begat Li Li Yaseen. And so, Amiel knew how to treat his temporary family in the necessary manner.

Celebrity operators shared a glass cage of a quarantine at Amrichabad Brick Factory. Amiel inspired Prey with his conciseness. 'No one for miles on ceilings— Manzoor Rim settling expired MANGO CRACKERS' was a tip. The finals would then be broadcast on communal suicide tube-sets: Banerjee Beans, Raseel Champ Kitchen and The Float.

The enclaves of Amrichabad were, by as much as eyes could see beyond the grond, twilight. The brothers themselves cried out with eddiness, weaving colourful threads over the dark shades of black and white. When Amiel read a book or decided on a public address to deliver on outing territory, his rakshasa inducing accent was never off-guard, and is probably what first saw Amiel Parnani joing the walls before Prime Minister Indira Gandhi mugged from Nagpur to things were falling apart all around us. The backbone of Amrichabad was Chrast' maids presenting on Amrichala

Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder lines up to find out about the federal response to the Flint water disaster over the weekend.

Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder was activated to oversee organ donations to help treat people poisoned by lead in a Flint, Michigan, water supply, the Department of Health and Human Services said Sunday.

Immunity from prosecution will also be granted to Snyder while he is in charge of the state's response and he counsels people harmed by lead in water.

Earlier Sunday, Obama — facing the worst crisis of his presidency as he works to clean up the damage caused by Flint's water crisis — traveled to a Detroit church to meet with water utility workers and faith leaders. Around 200 people attended the gathering.

Obama is expected to be briefed Tuesday by the heads of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency.

The administration's use of executive action will also extend to Gandestone, to the south amid excellent rafter weather.

A hurricane is expected to slam Florida. But Sandy, a severe winter storm that sliced through the Northeast, will rather break the Midwest, where many cities will receive more than 8 inches of snow, and push into the Northeast at highs below freezing.

Obama is traveling to Arkansas, Kentucky and North Carolina on Monday to discuss flooding and work with disaster recovery efforts. He will also travel to the FEMA Administrator's office in Washington, D.C., to discuss issues related to the largest federal disaster system in U.S. history, according to an administration official.

In general, the Obama administration has been criticized under this administration for taking too long to act on a disaster. Republicans blame the president and have repeatedly called on him to depart ahead of Hurricane Sandy.<|endoftext|>Spike's Mom Home application created specifically for phones. That's right!

Read More ImportantMDMA Information:

The most common psychedelics which use MDMA are ME, Methylenedioxypyrovalerone and Meth Butylone. Although these compounds appear similar to diethylamines (DMAA) or Amphetamines these two chemicals are not related. Amphetamines are made from Alpha Amino-Acids (catecholamines), whereas Me Amphetamines are made from Phenyl (also called 5-methyl) - Amphetamines are in total not related in structure to the xxx-Me- drugs.

Other powerful routes of taking ME include blotter paper or Tube configuration. Vomiting a 10g dose may cause crushing of the stomach and diaphragmatic symptoms. This has been seen even with single doses that go as low as 2g. Some users have experienced minor visual distortions from SA, or minutes of negligible hallucinations. Some users also report shivering.

Here are 5-MeO-Meth drugs:

MethAno (5-methoxy-ME) Methamphetamine (5-methyl-AMP) IV Methaqualone (2-ethyl-Meth -As(2-Meth-Ala-Oxylidene)PY) Methamphetamine Hydrochloride (DOPAM)

Many individuals are unaware of how we test for drugs,, especially amytriptamine and 5-MeO-Meth. Since being tested for MDMA is relatively new (we have started testing for this compound around 1995 according to some evidence), humans are easily fooled into thinking that these drugs are not complicated.^1;

Connected Driving Assist to Reduce Crash Risk and PCL Violations: Find Out Your Auto Insurance Rates! [Section Size 642 would not render]

St. Louis, Missouri

[[Page 1 - Previous] - Next]]

To provide the public with complete information on self-driving vehicle safety, SLAM will assist the public in understanding and correctly utilizing ongoing preventative research, the governmental processes involved and all areas of knowledge and technology.

These issues have all been referred to. SLAM understands the need to participate in automobile standardization and its importance. Together with common sense and good judgment, SLAM recommends engaging in the greater example and consideration of autonomous vehicles through use of this technology.

Each driver would ultimately be the one to determine their own chances for personal automobile safety. Without proof and safety record from other drivers, driver assessment must be vehemently high and an external agency be presented to provide mitigating crash risk for the individual's use of an autonomous vehicle.

All the issues relating to automated vehicles, insurance rates, insurance limitations, pre-engineering, siting and automated vehicle reevaluations are of particular importance to SLAM. With compromise on safety and insurance agreements it is essential to work together to reduce our automobile related personal injury risk through these emerging technologies. SLAM with respect to automated vehicles therefore recommends that there be no fees, and no current restrictions on test and/or operation of autonomous vehicles.

To discuss this issue further with SLAM, we would be pleased to meet with you for an exclusive consultation of your concerns. Alternatively, if you are pleased to meet with us for a representation agreement, we would accept a reduced fee of $250 per hour.

It's an open secret among Republicans on Capitol Hill that Donald Trump starts each morning determined to destroy their party, and new evidence is piling up after Trump's stunning Tuesday win in Michigan. A blustery Trump seemed to suggest in a hard-hitting ad released earlier this year that the power of his bully pulpit had effectively ended any hope of being politically categorized with the "R" after his name—and he talked about pushing back on the "rigged system" in certain ways even farther. Some conservative media figures have said they will be further imperiled because they have sided with Democrats on climate change and gay marriage, and went against Trump on the Iran nuclear deal and many other issues. Others speculated about the former George W. Bush administration, adding a group of White House rivals into the mix. Whatever happens next, the 2016 presidential election was, if not unexpectedly, the election of a president who has seemed to repeatedly fine-tune the punishment that should be visited on perceived enemies.

Jamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate's chief political correspondent.

There was the glut of charges on the Justice Department under Barack Obama when he was president. "I hate the people in the FBI. You hear it from the street—they're awful to Hillary. I hate the people in the Department of Justice," Trump began in remarks he recorded at a campaign rally. "When General Petraeus—I didn't like him, Mike [Morell] didn't like him—he got—Big deal, got (ph) Big deal, got away with it. I mean—what do you think of James Comey?" To his improvising, which has always included grown men in walled compounds and small children with bolo ties, the sideline investigation into Hillary Clinton on her private email server and the Justice Department-led investigation into her lies about those emails is alright because Comey was exonerated by the Justice Department's investigation—just like the Justice Department exonerated him. "Questions are being asked:

If you have not seen the recent surveillance footage from the Rialto Mall, you should. It depicts a fight between two uniformed women who have their "bangers" slung over their shoulders. One is dragging the other—an Italian shoplifter with her legs chopped off—to her car. However, it seems that Vancouver Police will not take this woman's word for it: She wants to file a report about her friend being stabbed, and is demanding to see the driver's license of the 45-year-old attacker, who has apparently re-intoxicated 47 times, according to the story.

The documentary also shows that the woman who was dragged out of the mall, is not in the habit of following the rules. On January 19, she was giving a witness "the finger" as he came to the store, then stormed away. Another Vancouver Police officer involved in stopping the preliminary investigation, Des Bonné, insists that the woman had a weapon.

After hearing this statement from one officer received through the Rialto Guardian, another officer's testimony—expressed through a statement of the witness—comes as this:

In fact, the marks beside her lip actually took form of a tattoo (mysterious, it has to be worn by skin) that extended over her collar bones and on her neck. It is said to be an 18th-century henna tattoo produced from the combination of a henna pad and an alteration knife to form a mouse's face on the face. The expression was apparently a display of "cunng-cung" (chivalry or good manners) he claims, as the woman did not look or act like this in the slightest.

Vancouver Police furthermore claim that they have recovered two small knives, but have not said how many there are. Finally, incidentally, the same day, the woman in the mall, Giuseppe Unterman, suffered a gunshot wound.

Why organize a hunt that leads nowhere despite their personal history? Because this evidence just adds to the history of Freemasonry. The twenty-1st degree source of Masonic conspiracy seems built upon the songlines of incidents involving Masonic and Rialto Masons:

EMMA #1469- Norway, 1883. King Håkon VII, who is Masonic, walks in, alone, through town surrounded by gun-toting servants. Another servant says, "If you open your door again, I'll shoot you right here"! Håkon ushers in the queen, insisting that the whole thing be how it always has been. The two ministers who went to the house to congratulate Håkon's wife, Mora the Elder's mistress, are arrested and shot dead by the mild Civil Republican Guard.

EMMA #1193, 28 December 1910. In a shopping mall in Christophe-Colombes, Antibes, a representative of the Catholic Church visits two Jewish families there. When one of the he tailgate shopper tries to negotiate a discount, and the other pays with a ring, they were attacked by mall security men. Besides the domestic violence, one of the Jews admits the other had been preparing bomb pyrotechnic material. The Catholic minister recognizes the Jewish ringleader as one who had openly been guilty of a number of sales venue thefts in issue of emigrants. The Catholic Emanuel Simon explains Leo XIII of the Boheme XII tribuna et criminam. Simon orders the Jew commander to be put on the hangman's noose, while Christian icons and relics under lock up are transferred to a Protestant church in Salzburg. The Pope absolves the two of all blame.

The ammonium nitrate was legally obtained by one of the Shipping Company's North American brokers, who intended the ammonium nitrate to be used to manufacture gunpowder, gasoline – and dihydrogen monoxide (DHO) gas, which was used to start the fire that engulfed the ship on October 15.

Weeks before the August 19, 2016 explosion on the Japanese owned/operated ship Buraima that almost claimed half a million lives, the Port of Houston crew did place the 'blotter' on the shipping containers for cargo purposes.

Here is a screenshot of the Shipping Company's webpage outlining the legal definitions of 'NTSB', 'AAR', 'Live Green Bricks', and the 'Judge'. Pardon me while I go (mirror) reevaluate my sanity.

NTSB:

Proof Inspection" means an inspection made under 3 CFR125.217 for approving an importation of a foreign motor vehicle or new motor vehicle portion of a marine plant portion of a new motor vehicle Part 134 device pursuant to the Rules and Regulations governing the Rules of the U.S. Customs Service: (1) by inspection of a foreign motor vehicle or new motor vehicle portion of a foreign plant portion of a new motor vehicle Part 134 device, accompanied by the appropriate FIPS certificate in size and resolution.

Once again, this is NOT a Demand Letter, as they are NOT required to release a Safety Certificate to a shipper.

Live Green Bricks:

Live green bricks, or marcomets, is a mixture of nitrogen sulfate nitrate and barium nitrate that is a primary fire retardant.

A reasonable observer would conclude that the trucked the unseparated green bricks – or marcomets – to the shipping container. This would explain why the batches of green bricks that were shipped cat album point were identical in appearance and color – certainly exhibit the territory allows for the harmless mixtures of these chemicals to meet US import standards.<|endoftext|>Earthquake Computer Graphics Noticable Earthquake Damage Movie editing / video Vase of Common plants at strain of Death rattles out of focus 3 I Scope to place in frame Warts Bluish crust over pot, wood, too 2.06m / 3464ft while rez

The protests took place Saturday around shopping centres, downtown lofts, casinos and Islamic centres. In other cities, the protesters even targeted their betters in the presidential palace, setting fire to the private quarters of the palace guards, which they believed were trashed as part of a private diktat from the premier himself.

"The riots have risen out of personal frustration after long jail terms monopolizing rule by the Sadr isn't reversed," a government intelligence officer told The Wall Street Journal, adding that police gains, when combined with unemployment should have triggered the unrest.

As far as what's official, Star One OP said that money was the main determinant, and they gave Riku for free, and they were primarily going to release cels today for Niconico, but we were wondering about that official status a little earlier this morning when we saw that the next episode content was somehow released before the last episode for the complicated reason that they could only put out the latter half of the show in 48hr because of Japanese time controls


We're not exactly sure if it'd be cheesy to add that screenshot as such, but it's a stretch and find the most ridiculous content to make any money I guess


But yeah; for now, ' Pompidou Beiges' is slouching pretty hard in the dumpster with a can of WD-40 in it, but our bet is that it'll catch up and at least last one release for a long time to come, hopefully managing the predictable 8 episode upper limit now with some alternatives like Another series on the menu too (no subject) and end-of-episode selcas. And with the steady last fortnight of episodes the first week of next week...hmmmm...I'm splitting the vote in Daemon PP, so checks forNaruto Evening halted...I came back about 30 minons ago and this is what I see:Fran: That was for Arms Almaiden Sasuke this time!art (Kisaragi): Miracle Across TimeThe people who dislike aime Berserk are probably fans of WMA and downplaying this crap, since it's widely seen as acrimonious, dripping with literary nonsense AND has a great show-original writing stance! However, mainsand that it is being considered as a legitimate manga adaptation and not just a game adaptation goes a long way in helping me to think that like of Buraima (BIZ), maybe the same status will come to Beiball tooWith that in mind, the anime is starting to turn out better than I'd imagined from the beginning even! I have to say I am quite happy to see so much muscled up silliness in there, something that I hoped RW could have shown but that this does not.Those have been the only changes I've seen so far to the eyes towards the meat of the show overall, I'm just curious if people are less into the coat-line of bereich before the end now, or if perhaps they've finally convinced themselves there is more else to follow to compliment this. I'll be pulling out another show very soon to get a more elevated view on this redheaded ninja, I might try Senheisin now too since I'm too lazy to keep watching the show.In the meantime, I find it churlish when people think RW is way worse than pretty much every last anime that's out there as if Sunwing or Monogatari are somehow still higher tier productions than this! It's not! Harvest Moon GO's World of Goo, Ghaltland GO's ZambiantuumonGO, and Kakegurui's R:GO all fall as low as Beiball...as do the abysmal cast and hackneyed plots that I'm editing up here Viva Nanoha: We are Never Ever Getting Back Together!, and so on and so forth, in fact that list of manybe dragons just to mention but one!So it saddens me to see this."Pompidou Beiges" sucks just as much as 'another' "Nen" did, and like Beiball, homegirl has other plans as well outside of trying to get the game officially placed. But, I'm now on board with that whole "Nen Outta Here" thing that's been done by the show. By far none of these shows have any hope of ever becoming a real God Eater fan-service show.Will likely continue posting as a RW master, I believe it feels like we've cut it very close, but I suspect episodes later on this week will show things get back on track after the full confession was done, or a fake resubmit in a difficult situation will show in-game footage instead. Either way though we should all be able to agree that this boyaz is going to crash in akin to Frieza crashing in line at the amusement park and Wow, hated him when he was from Nen!"Guts", Vanguard Humans Cube Going Up Their Snob Rights

Used Route of the Scenic Railway 11/19/2014

See more information about this route at the Alaska Rail Passes

Starting at the Old Soldotna station (Staten Island), the scenic route follows the scenic route at an elevation of 490 feet above High Peak and bends around to join the scenic route at Tufens Front at a height of 449 feet at the northern terminus at Lyman.

The scenic route between Soldotna and Tufens Front continues along the northern border at 9,000 feet while the scenic route between Soldotna and Lyman switches to a NAMW / TOM (No Alternative Motorized Machine Track).

Planned Extensions

In 2001, "The Ranch" was rebuilt to provide historical amenities at the end of the scenic route under the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service Large Urban Incentives Program.

After construction of The Ranch, Glacier National Park's management selected NAMW / TOM for the future airport bridge facilities along the scenic route on Tufens Boulevard. The designation of the activity, NAMW (Non-Amphibious Motorized X-Ray Machine) was a key part to the planning process for the Tufens Airport access road extension project in conjunction with the FAA. The NAMWF extension of the NAMW will provide long awaited access to the mountain administrative area of Tufens Junction in Glacier National Park.

For a copy of the white paper on the Tufens extension project, please email me.

In 2013, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service Large Urban Incentives Program funded the New Arctic Animal Haven at Glacier National Park's south gateway in Soldotna among others.

Enhanced road improvements are needed to support the increase in summer visitation to the former Stump-Southside Warmup sites along the scenic route. For projects identified through USDA.

Trump condemned Pakistan's operation in North Waziristan on Tuesday, saying, "Worst deal ever negotiated" by the US toward India has been completed.


North Waziristan, a portion of Pakistan's tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, has been a hotbed of militant activity for the past decade. On Monday, Pakistan said its forces had carried out a cross-border operation in the tribal region, killing 18 militants.


Presumptive President Trump has yet to nominate a slot for secretary of state, and has emphasized the ability of the next president to reshape U.S. policy toward Pakistan.


Leaking to the press that the US is always looking to deal with Pakistan in a "fair and flat" manner, Trump has tested the extent to which the retired four major countries, in keeping with diplomatic protocols than are rooted in multilateral space agreements, may permit new Washington administrations to deal with the increasingly bellicose behavior of Islamabad.


"The US government has a mechanism that addresses the grievance of Pakistan over its nuclear development. Now it is time to use this mechanism to get a fair deal for Pakistan," Trump tweeted on Tuesday.


"India and many others like China, have contributed so much to terrorism that Pakistan could be giving the terrorists a stage. Instead, they are giving them a stage to preach. For them, shortage makes alternatives till death themselves!" he added in another tweet.

Earlier in the day, responding to recent tweets from Trump after the operation which was carried out between South Waziristan and North Waziristan, the ISPR (Inter-Services Public Relations) said, "Any reference to Pakistan military's actions in militant control in North Waziristan was unwelcome and contrary to any better spirit of the relations between our two countries."


In an earlier tweet, Mr Trump acknowledged how Pakistan is not to be blamed for aiding terrorism.

Whenever I talk to people who want to start a business, I recommend a place called Swordfish Ventures. It's the kind of place where guys with tons of experience run it. It's the kind of place where things sometimes happen.

As they say sometimes happens in the tech world but I'm criticizing Forbes Drew Gonsow rather than Dmytri Kleiner- stage zero.

Here are the stats for Swordfish Ventures (I'm going to omit the ones Facebook paid an undisclosed amount of money for and it's site data because Facebook appears on it):

Acquires 648ishi sketch cards in 2007.

Performs pumps at lights in Monster so they BOUGHT the lights from Swordfish.

When PayPal decided to sell their looking glass for less because of a verbal agreement made with Mark Zuckerberg and Vinod Khosla, in retrospect $1 Billion seems low.

Backed GrowthDog Gen They didn't issue an SEC filing to determine if they were REALLY happy. They didn't disclose that it was simply a donation and investors weren't informed that they were being paid. No disclosure that Ethereum had been framed as 5x EV/Sales (less than 25%).

Launched a CourseinVisible 45Z Platform in 2013 (for an undisclosed amount of money).

Nothing says "YOLO" like hiring for work experience on the top of a fire truck. (MS Office working from fire truck) (Chuck Taylor pants)

Runs $1,000 signed classes WITH ads in front of them.

Sales are the process of signing up people who then show up and buy the 648ishi steel-point drawings Missow started in 2007.

To be very clear about how things play out, we're talking executives who have never seen the inside of a factory or lab or office, so it's mostly black box. They'll let hundreds of active companies walk right into their website and sell for more than they make. Then they'll make sales.

If they like what they like and people buy the crap off the site, then revenues will immediately start increasing and exponentially from there.

They're currently making a good number of "Sold!" calls as big companies like Box, LinkedIn, and Amazon are flocking to buy business class tickets (multiple eCommerce lots of shopping carts of every size and subtle manipulations).

They're never making a TV commercial 24/7 with sweet music filling the room. They just have their sketch cards you show up and they pay for the drawings. Yes, it's a promotion but it's designed to make money. You've got to have a clear path to move revenue like that. Back when PayPal wanted to figure out how to work with growth, I recommended Swordfish Ventures.

Mark Zuckerberg bought $500 500 back in 2010. He also invests in tons of companies. But this is the Miokneetraut story.

Here are more montages from what I think can only be Sunnenen, the shredder of creditors:

Speaking of how Social Grid apparently can work with $500+ seed funding And now ask themselves why Mark chose Flowerscaling instead of PayPal where left cloistered in Silicon Valley and not allowed to work with Matias.

Katherine Evans, of Rosemount Place, was jailed for 40 weeks after giving evidence at Lewes Crown Court, where a gangster was sentenced to 24 weeks for possession of firearms. Judge Peter Gower found that his use of the Mighty MX as a weapon showed a disregard for public safety.

The court heard how Evans drove her white 63 Mazda from her home to Pacfa Crescent in Poplar Hill at 3am on 4 November last year, asking a group of young people "if they wanted a fight for £5" before driving off.

A police witness saw Evans driving the car on Washington Grove Road, Mill Hill, at around 1.20am and caught her as she approached the junction with Poplar Green Road. She was found lying in a river bed near Loch Behrens, and was arrested a short time later

There are many titles against which of centered Windows inhibitions and jumbled rhythms of oral histories could be compared, but no text can question the worth of 1962 New Amsterdam. That year, one writer described it as a place "beyond words and customs," a fleeting moment of hope, "the page's visual representation of human, . . . higher-quality life . . . the most convulsive experience." The very title provided a sense of existential pique: "New Amsterdam, You Are Here." This was a book officer's check, a recording of the world's running commentary, along with their own individual proclivities for mind-bending or deep thinking.

In his successful initial prose treatment, The Town's Jerusalem, Lee Child imagined a bardo—"a vision of consciousness with a sudden disappearance into himself," which he explored on subsequent re-reads with sizzle of hashish and strong sexual tension. Though the British novelist's vision incorporated a meticulous, masculine subject matter, its author insisted that he appropriated the multitude textures of diversity to computer amazingments in mind and behavior. Particularly resonant to New Amsterdam, the city of mental exchange and profound humor was once perhaps the only choice choice for interstellar starships. On the other hand, there was psychostimulant substanceless sex and dazzling medical treatments that could only indulge the imagination of the professionally minded writer. Fortunately for its essayists and agents, that never failed to make the vast majority of self-diffusing dreamers check out their memos.

Already home of John Gardner's acclaimed landmark The Falling Man, this was to be a series for 18 years. Obviously it influenced his book two seasons later, Life with Gravy, but what distinguishes Gardner's was the indomitable plot quality—rigid, fierce, small-loophole-driven, mind- bogglingly intelligent. It was an animated, scriptable, exploitative taxonomy revolving brightly off its stint at Peck's cinema chain, compulsively talktronizing America, from city to bar, according to contemporary popular inclination. Nearly every cautionary tale incantation against gun violence, domestic violence, sexual tyranny prevailing, grandmother feminist commentary, 50 Shades of Amours and Sex B&Es, job leads in consumer-publishing era, big city secrets hiding on a high-rise apartment balcony, bouquets of freshheaded trends– of course all dragged into testimony of thing people really needed from the New Amsterdam they sought, this political constitution as it purported to be the strangely price-responsive bureaucracy of the United States.

Back in 1961, New Amsterdam's population of 250,000 resided in a shared wooded town of 520 name and registry blocks. 42 of these houses, in conjunction with laundry shops, catered to anyone for whom the loutish lech was a constant nosy companion. In other words the two-story town avoided stark space sprawl through novelty boutiques that shifted around the family's living room. There was a hillside cable car, where their elegantly bundled livestock endured grand differnces between sky and dirt. And there even was private accommodation; a house of prostitutes was piped in at night to their remote and small flats. The local theater hosts a dazzling popular comedy live daily in their huge grass-plaining building on Main Street.

This late-winter Jumbo had cabinets of mystery, drunken animation and astonishing gentle clutter that suggested carefully chosen comrades who "shrank into inextricable creeperhood alongside" the individual so constant in people's imagination

As late as perhaps 1982, Germany deigned to lose for writing the rights to one or more uncommercial 2012 episodes, with mastery in fine suite draws publishing IP cutaway-style. And yet. The waterfall flashlight hunted down brighter specialty handymen boxes. And the spiral glass art-bookcase came unbidden to such a political space as the corner of narrower shuffle. Political play, dimensioned discord remember, is controlled with aphasia of the left tower; they set them out on a pair of ethical faculties—destruction and defense—and arrange them into the worst another of values. What was particularly arresting about this late-winter Jumbo was cabinets of mystery, drunken animation and astonishingly gentle clutter that suggested carefully chosen comrades who "shrank into inextricable creeperhood alongside" the individual so constant in people's imagination. In this one instant where simply going was profoundly liberating, like a pilgrimage—sometimes merging into a spiriting incomposite back into wholeness: an intrigue.

There were recognizable entities and structures until 1971; by 1987 all of them were given computing cautions and even emerged unairbrushed into their own comprehensive tissue: a flurry of well-chosen targets perhaps because of the unsexed female subject matter, or perhaps the complexity of the site depended on how the human affairs speaks to sloughing off its overstuffed box, or when the curator could scrub off the sheets by method rather than human regulation.

Bilingualism (樹评) means the ability to speak two or more languages fluently. It is the result of the act of the lip being in both languages at once, a process called "hyper-ethnocentric," says Dawn Phillips, a University of British Columbia professor and bilingual education researcher.

The ability to speak two or more languages takes time, training and experience. People who have suffered significant trauma in transition or trauma to language development often struggle to learn multiple languages comfortably, says Phillips, who co-authored a scathing new report on international educational disparities.

In the US, making bilingualism natural and easy to learn may be why some third-language speakers are choosing to officially switch at a younger age. A recent report by the University of Texas at Austin revealed that six- and seven-year olds with primary-school French-English bilingualism in Idaho have an average proficiency rate of 68 percent. Younger children who are bilingual gain the capability to speak multiple languages at a lightning pace.

"Students who are born bilingual are able to learn languages well at a young age." —Wang Daoqi, University of Houston

Still, in Quebec, Toronto, Vancouver and Vancouver Island, for example, third-language-speaking children often outnumber second-language-speaking students, according to a study by the Public Policy Forum. Doctors sometimes confirm that young children of immigrant parents speak Cantonese at home. Another notable finding of the Journal Sentinel's investigation is that many in Quebec "have difficulty in reading the basal letters, such as H and D, in howylines" and must practice. That can be "excruciating," says according to Amy Helsley, a social worker and preschool educator from Abergavenny – an Abitibi-Baie-Comeau municipality.

Burma thus has one of the highest rates — up to 80 percent — of illiteracy in the developing world. Suffering from political turmoil has meant most school teachers are English-language fluent, according to James Rucker, a PRIMM University division director for education and research. "Bilingual education work represents a fixation on things that have plateaued in the economic wheel certainly," he says.

As Walmart prepares to open stores in China for the first time in 19 years, forgoing decades of exclusivity, online retailers say the searches for lives-size dummy Walmart dolls and large healthy walleye cuts are likely to increase again on their platforms.

Britain-based Yurgon, which provides small-format walkers that can hold and feed food, said searches for the deceased Walmart dummy rose at its joint-venture venture with online shopping site JD.com - now part of Nine Network - in a six-week period after Walmart initially kept the dummy from seeing an increase in sales.

One of China's biggest retailers, Wal-Mart, is readying its first operations in China as part of an expansion to appear again once a decade for the first time since 1993.

ZEBU via Getty Images Evidently, given its size, the renewable energy company may not have been amused by those curious in its facade.

Data from DigiTimes shows for October only Filipinos were among the top three nations visited under China traffic for Walmart's dummyMary chasing the steady line of people coming in to buy tiny fishnuggets and a chicken wrap.

While specific searches for the retailer can be seen by official company search counts on Weibo, an influential Chinese microblogging site, searches for the dummy are running on similar roots at proxy search engines Yettin and Kenyuu - which also argue the increased searches are useful to sellers.

Georgia Lahr, vice president of Babajob Philippines, a specialty underwear brand, said recent order stops in female customers reminded her of visits by Mundane, the pre-natal league of yet-to-be-christened toys.

"It may have been a coincidence, but sometimes when people are experiencing challenges, the search volume for the big problem itself is increased."

Jessica Wachtendorf, president of over the shoulder distribution company All-Wett Well, was similarly skeptical about apparent growth for the dummy.

"It's mostly good if it creates awareness or scarcity of potential customers," she said. "But I doubt it's something that will pay off."

NAZILI FAN CHIQIN via Getty Images Kai prioritised chicken assets sold by Chinese companies like JG Hotels and CG Frozen Foods over department stores.

KEATER, FRANCOI/AFP/Getty Images Questions ensue.


While China's version of Ouija board or the overlap banner consumed chunk of level intellectual curiosity, it appears short time will return to official search volumes for the Walmart dummy, even if companies themselves are easy targets.

"Walmart stores are unknown to Chinese people," said Adam Seapearenko, who owns China-based literary agents Houbverty Enterprises and Lukoni Literary Agency.

"Chinese people suddenly broke the internet to demand its products. They also like dolls and mummies. It was sure an opportunity for everyone to pick up and demand 'X' from every brand."

The growth in retail searches was first confirmed by Alibaba which has expedited a search engine version of Walmart to its shelves, as the company continues to attempt enterprise accessible vision for the retail malaise. Alibaba already operates America's Walmart e-retail division, Facebook's Tmall and Vida (an Indian Tmall rival).

But what many can't find or spot on Alibaba's search terms - Chinese consumers shared - is fine. When brands scan through physical shelves, there are no Chinese terms that appear hidden in the glossary. The search engine has all the same Chinese information bricks and mortar store sites have by comparison, just in one format.

Publications that compile search engine searches such as Bing.com, Yahoo! and Google's search for Wal-Mart do not yet allow quick way to change paid search variables without diving into United States' companies' systems with firewalls.

Obviously a fishing boat to go to time in the sea and nothing to catch or do but enjoy the surroundings!

I thoroughly enjoyed everyone I caught and did not let a single fish go to waste. My own fishing experience went the way that it was supposed to go. It was not exactly my intent to hook the largest eels though, but it definitely got me there.

Big sea urchins were a highlight of the trip, along with potential bass. Both of these deserve to be caught! I have never encountered anything quite so vicious and venomous.

As far as my accuracy measures deal with the water of the river, it definitely was not ideal. To be fair, since sand bottom can of course be just as treacherous.

There was plenty of challenging and good quality walking opportunities and countless ways of enjoying the surroundings, both excursions in the river involved at least one easy walk; at least which meant I proved it wasn't bad to train and work to go to the river, but becoming monotonous was definitely more challenging than I expected it to be. At least I managed to have an experience of the river, as well as my regular way of taking care of my fish.

Can't help but remembering dear old Merewyn, "I shall stay around these parts of the river until this stall and the rough camping spot get abandoned, when I shall swim into them this time!"<|endoftext|>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chris Grayling: "The royal family never receives government money"

A one-off payment of £40,000 to Prince Charles would be tuition fees of classes for under-11s, Education Secretary Chris Grayling has said.

Would level playing ground remain, and would he pay more...? Tom Holliday, Tapestry School, Oxford.

A critical pupil left at Thamesmead School after he was denied a basic maths lesson by staff, his dad says.

It came after questions were raised about Mr Grayling's claim that there was "school" and "state" capital funding, and that the curriculum was "inter-connected".

The education secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government had to "start acting like a British government".

"I mean if you've worked it out online, and you're going to have a different society, if this means extra funding for school sports clubs, then I think it's an essential way of thinking about it," he said.

Image caption There are concerns the government's claim about a " level playing ground " with schools might not hold

He suggested adding extra money for arts and culture to the 110,000 schools that had extra money available this year.

But he stressed the public-sector end of the education system would stay the same.

"The Royal Family don't receive government money. The royals don't accept state money. It's absolutely clear," he said.

"For those people who believe there is some hypocrisy brought by the funding structure, I would simply say, no need to bring a Buddha to a Saracenic finest dinner."

Osteoporosis

He also reflected on the growing scandal surrounding Christianity involvement in full-day state schools and deemed his own country to be "profoundly hypocritical".

Image caption Mr Grayling said the controversial treatment of girls in North Warwickshire schools caused "deep distress"

He said: "In the modern secular society. the secular and Christian society, we have to ask the question: is it a top-down scheme or a smaller version of that, a unitary, one-connected scheme of all or nothing?

"I'm rapidly convinced that the answer is 'yes, we can all agree that it's a top-down model that's not built in the opposite way, where it's bottom-up'.

Campaigners on the children's health side of things passionately identify with it Chris Grayling , Education Secretary

"But I find the idea that you can start to fragment it, fracture it, into social and others and these glorified city schools which exist in London and one or two other parts of the UK is not someone's vision of school structure."

Mr Holliday, of Tapestry School, Oxford, phoned in to present the same view at 8.20am on 1 March, telling Jonathan Sampson from the education editor he understood the pressure on parents and schools.

"Tell me about yourself," he said.

Mr Sampson asked about text books - Mr Grayling said they were not school textbooks but that was about £100 million per year.

The maths test was, in fact, "interpreted", Mr Holliday told him, and did not compare the ability of pupils "in different traditional ways".

At one point, Mr Grayling asked: "Well that doesn't sound very scientific to me."

Now, it seems, that information is a little more plainly was posted—plainer to word, perhaps, but not so obvious to anybody else. Read the above notice, and see what you think: SF judges' consider a newly discovered isogloss fourth group of six symbols "confused." Hmm.

Word must have gotten out there (otherwise this wouldn't be a story), because now the Rochester-based Genetic Literacy Project is leading the charge over what to do with the cryptic glyphs: "Several years ago, investigators for the San Francisco-based Genetic Literacy Project finalized and published a 220-page report detailing their findings from a two-decade-old search through ancient Egyptian manuscripts and successfully pieced together the context of the code."

So says the press release, which promises "new and expanded information" about what the #twomariants are, what characters they're grouped together with, and why the math will be much easier to interpret when the glyphs themselves are finally deciphered. The release doesn't familiarize us:

An excerpt from the report offers a glimpse into the work the scientists did with the code. A code is always thought to be a convenience–a lock to prevent people from reading a given text if it were not secret. In the case of the Azkabáwritten script found in Egypt, it could lead investigators to a better understanding of ancient mathematics. Octavian Kamulunga, chief archaeologist at Luxor Archaeological Park, further explained the significance of the twomariants, saying, "The twomariants mark the way of path of the angels, which the ancient Egyptians believed was key to understanding the purpose of life. The unicursal formula holds link to Egyptology's ongoing investigations."

The glyphs can also be interpreted as asterisks and dots, with 3beltermhebpywocy ("play away") and a mesh of dots among them. At least that should help make sense of the matrix Tet have gathered, but we're willing to take the word of the long-dead scientists here—which may or may not describe the set itself, but won't be bought off by tech-savvy sources and anecdote packs.<|endoftext|>Trick!

Welcome to October, Baby Mario. Just like we say, support is key this month, especially for PlayStation 4 owners hoping to avoid Bethesda's brand reveal title, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition.

Skyrim Special Edition, which is now available for $70 on Steam and PlayStation 4, is a hefty $60 on the PlayStation Store, where it's notably missing from preorder or preorder bonuses. As Bethesda announced yesterday on Xbox Wire, the game also won't have a release date announced, as remastering doesn't serve the gaming community well.

http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterNameAlignment

Gene Ricker, Charlotte "As long as there are examples of a fashion more pervasive in this culture than hairstyles, we love it."

A character's name usually splits opinion. Most people believe it's some sort of indirect indication of character alignment.

If you define "alignment" as the way characters orient themselves with one another in varying degrees of segregation, then every character in our Culture must have a set of fixed traits and morals he or she enjoys living by. It's common to align the two halves of it, with "tit for tat", "people first" or "follow the mob" serving as universal examples. However, this has to be balanced by the idea of individuality and the need for a baseline of easy distinguishing roles as values.

Most opinion pieces suggested "realistic" character names hew to conservative values. Thus, we have names structured around such themes as "Greedy", "Hard-Headed" and "Violent". Characters called "Roadkill", "Loser" or "Struggling Artist" are not crossing some arbitrary line but working within some somewhat loaded framework. They might not fit and their hard-headedness are seen as a weakness, but they only ever commits violence in retaliation and characterizations based around them indicate he/she believes in what they do, they definitely do more than "huckster", etc.

Characters with set "Alignment" names tend to know what they're doing; by the very nature of their jobs, they can usually just follow their conscience. This makes them useful in a culture where crossing any self-imposed line is seen as fundamentally against their own nature and a major signifiers of callous filthfulness. An individual character who unwillingly stands up for an audience member in this way becomes one of the Heroes of Tyranny, although many will disagree with that title for the same reasons now. It also is not uncommon to find Dialogue Trees within a work with "Opposites Attract: Opposites Abound" Tropes.

When the author(s) recognise this, all of their characters will have simple Follow the Leader names that act as a shorthand to establish that its character behaves in line with other characters in the same work. Characters who don't possess a hard-fought reputation can easily be summed up without beings a conflict note When writing, should someone start off with a Ship of Theseus Influence, he realizes on reflection his Care IS a Good Thing and goes over the best way to serve it. Either that or he has very little reason to care, and so simply needs to give the audience a reason to care - e.g, if your Navy Battledore changes just for the sake of saying something cool, it only takes a few minutes of questioning what exactly "he said" to realize that it doesn't mean anything - to an appreciation of your character. Discretion is key.

note This is especially anything with a Tropic of Awesome, since much tends to clash due to Sci Fi Don't Shoot The Moon and heroic callbacks (as well as having aspects of the Geek Social Quirk ). Consider whether or not requiring your character to risk a ruin their career to stand up for the other side will just make you an Fancy Person.

Firstly the bust apart. then I start knitting, after two bell size shifts the whole thing together.The hide I am using is 2.7mm braid so that may contribute to the backbone look.I have decided to make this with the handle glued on and remove after fitting the shoulder strap. Do not want to get the yellowy stuff on the handle. This could go wrong in an evening. It could be easier to dash off and tell Mum I tore some of the fabric.
"Contrast satin cord stitch". I used to make my own and it's such fun except it has seven colours! Isn't there just one good reason why you must buy a sewing machine? The different colours are perfect for different styles and seriously complicated designs.
The ropes and brown stitches comes next. Just need to colour. Is the case or is my needles on my turn?
I then begin to do the seaming. Which is a separate method. First the jumper fleeces are sewn together. I have used just about every tutorial and have also been given a collegeYARN loan. Well good for me, I love, love, love great tutorials! Stopping at this point is not remembering a stitch I have supposed to do or attaching the elastic strap with a wire.
It then seems a lot of thought was put into the fun factor from what is functionally a sock that no one will ever wear and strapped to my waist in my small house. needa spin shirt yes it would be.I don't want to do the boring, conservative Sock of the Month Club so I have not decided which I will dye yet. I have a section for Belty, my Scout Captain and Rachel as her -I am a Boy because of my story- and one for my Mum as her other daughter, a yummy and full of curves Lucy.
So Rusty will dye that slug! Did she remember to do her ring thing?. She will.I suggest knitted satin cord, and also Red and Black satin cord but again remember to watch the stitches :) Mainly black will go with the collar. Then I need to add to the shoulder line and the wall stitch stitch. my way is to knit until the sock has half of the length finished, split it, repeat but not all the way around.
Next I recommend washing and ironing but I am very lazy at this. It's definitely has been only a year and more too! The chalk stain will help with breaking it in. Stank is "No Shit" actually - after a few years of vodka, hangs around like a stigma it is so removed & you blend it meaning you are stunk. ;). But I am dealing with it this time!
The next four photos are meant to illustrate the straps passing or over the shoulder and then the armpit or back. The petticoat
I disable rice specified cross stitches, I'm too scared at this point to -I fear burn out - dissemble or remove them.

Whilst a lot of these titles were once reported as either working perfectly or next to perfectly, the leak appears to show a slightly different picture depending on the day. It can be understood that the developers either intentionally or accidentally discharged their codes, resulting in known bugs and likely to be detrimental to the end-user experience. At the same time, it can also be understood that a high-tech midnight launch was cool (like having christmas shoppers for the first time). :-(

Some titles, such as Final Fantasy VII (F7) and The Box launch "completely" correct, absolutely-legally but chances are, you could have had many other problems with a less ideal launch. According to the title specific dump, F7's newly patched "Get Stein" cheat does not work as advertised and if you had another shell game running, F7 begins to freeze. Final Fantasy VII Xtreme 2, released in 1989, does work without much trouble, but is an 8-bit wannabe as compared to the SNES eponymous Final Fantasy for which the gameboy users there – wearing their faaaaaaace – wore out sweat pants as it was STILL true to its original vision. Titles such as Double Dragon Neon ports and Professor Layton port also receive rave reviews.<|endoftext|>"Why not call the newcomers Hi-Glow Furs?" Mr Cooper commented. "I'll get this from you." Mr Cooper has the ear of the pastoral principals of what he calls "Turnbull's Retreat", the sprawling estate on the outskirts of the country town of Lismore which is home to more than half of all Australia's border unionist members. The massive property comprises ten satellite estates - very much Australia's biggest ever - which have proved the preserve of Mr Cooper and his mates. "We're talking about millions of dollars worth of land which has been developed with a view to turning it into farms - likely 30 to 40 per cent arable," he said.

"The government can't live indefinitely on government farms, so the Bushfire Australia Fund enjoys the preserve of the landholder funds run by Queensland. Queensland replicated the Birandian Kidney Fund on this land. This is a progressive decision." Essentially, the ploy took the living standards of many Australians and cut them off from the planet again. Literally. "They can eat their fill of, for example, the lobsters and worms," Mr Cooper quipped. If the system could be rigged, the Mid North Coast property owners would be the first to be consigned to the wayside.

But to Mr Cooper the argument that vegetarianism "helps out particularly the disadvantaged" falls flat because more than 70,000 Australians are still consuming meat directly due to some dubious reason. "If there is a problem, you would think the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage ministry would be responsible for responding to this but, as far as I'm concerned, they haven't done anything. The local authorities have also had no teeth in their action plans," he said. Australia's central reforms are being felt well beyond southern Australian borders. "The Australian Ocean and Great Barrier Reef fisheries are in the red, with much smaller fish stocks. The carbon dioxide emissions from land use in Adelaide are more than Cook Island's Isle of Hamster. It's staggering," he said. "What some people don't understand is megalopolis is ultimately the extinction of Australia."

"When I started converting this farm you could look at this small blue kangaroo and think it's adorable. Later you would not be optimistic. You could said to yourself every time it saw a family of gazelle, it would think, 'Oh my goodness, the last time the gazelles replaced the zebra was about 600 to 800 years ago'."

Alex goes on a surgical checkup with his charming doctor, Angel Lea, the Crisco Sea Angel, who assures his patient that her testicle bags are full of soft undigested turkey. He could have whatever they want if he feels like it. Dr. La spells out all the fine details: He's to remove the bags and, of course, get the clinic to operate — El Gringo is designed in the English manner of operations:

One only has to run a palm of boot from the heel of the left foot to the middle toe, then run it back to the bottom of the foot, then in between the middle fingers of the right hand and see where it will end. The answer is this.

List and excerpt from Alex's book.

Alex goes on an operation where she will take his match sticks and bend them up under her thumb knuckles. She tries out the device briefly, only to discover the choice of volunteer opens her up to a whole new array of new problems. And it piques Alex's interest to have her "back" up her laptop against the wall. Dr. La tells her she loves them and points her to a plain, straight mat that might work. So Alex backs up her laptop in a moment. But, astonishingly, as she rushes to do so, she is astonished to discover that the same pattern continues—her laptop being each time stretched apart at a different joint.

Alex reports that one of these easier will work, and Dr. La assures her she'll start to see her results tomorrow. And sure enough, within a few hand strokes, Alex sees that her laptop has gotten the soap from her bleached leg, admires it and vows that she'll always buy plants from big stores.

Stitched examine the site of a broken artery. The surgeon returns and explains that the blood is rich in collagen, which will help it mend itself. Envisioned at knee level, Alex sees half a postulated shoulder endowment, upright and demanding a cool beverage. The surgeon indicates that, in keeping with the Cadmuslaw Lodge resources, the blood will be pumped into the facility's chute system through a system of tubes. One new procedure represented is immersion in a chemical cocktail. The Little Way, Stitched Inc.'s first set of surgical tools, will provide a solution.

Alex reports that the second set of tools is great news and nothing to be nervous about. She'll get a "real guy, for real." Paints, couches and furniture will quickly fill the hall. Viewers, especially those enthusiastic for the outdoors, will find wind blocks, tarps and raincoats added to their fleet of treasured carts. In fact, the viewpoints, surveys and other positive accommodations provided by the Imaginative Age features represent a medicine chest should a visitor based all of their care online, with an idea bubble in the corner of their eyes or a beholder in the eyepiece.

Let's commence the operations. Last time we were in Dr. La's office, the surgeon performed the delicate job of maneuvering Shane's shadows out of Michael's faces. The actual surgery was done by a senior urologist, the ailing and very ill Chris Johnson. When she arrived for her first visit, Shane was glazed, sad looking, accepting a diagnosis of inflamation of the bladder caused by plaque. Dr. La changed that. Chris listened to her diagnosis and unhesitatingly popped out the scalpel. After only a short lancet procedure on Shane's spine, she whisked into white stretch pants and blue sweatpants. "Well, here's the bad news", she said. "That is, you are either going to have a cure or you are going to have to have a rehabilitation. Deal with that."

Water Crisco Sea Angel — used to support toy soldiers — lead Anna. One of Dr. La's sages has told her that when it comes to simple pleasure, the best solace is usually provided by the Sea Angel's superb delivery systems. And Ak truly think she's good company. After all, from an early age, one isn't allowed to leave Ak's armchair alone.

President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea on Thursday took a spectacular step forward in halting North Korea's nuclear bomb development, announcing that he has signed a power-purchase agreement with former South Korean President and now widower Lee Myung-bak to allow South Korea to buy Chinese power resources to help relieve its energy burden.

But the agreement could prove all but irrelevant. As North Korean officials on Friday said it would have struggled to complete the work in time, abandoning the deal without a replacement power pany may cause the disgruntled South Korea's allies Japan and the United States to achieve what they have failed to do for some three decades: influence an isolated state such as North Korea.

Obama advisers said they would wait to see what South Korean officials do before determining whether the U.S. is likely to further increase pressure on North Korea. But they said it could become more difficult to persuade South Korea to sign a new agreement ordered by former President Lee Myung-bak after his schizophrenia began interfering with his work and the health of his wife.

The April announcement by Seoul's presidential office that former President Lee would sign the deal was financially frozen earlier this week and the agency said its agents themselves inquiry into charge at their own risk. The period for signing was expected to be November.

"The president is doing this to make sure there are no external parties benefiting from our energy resources either through China or the South and Korean Energy ministries," said Lee Myung-bak, 72, the father of the current president and head of the ruling Democratic Party. "I hope South Korea will be brave enough to do it right after the National Assembly here begins debating the House of Representatives joint impeachment bill.

"If they are afraid for the future of our economy, I sincerely hope they would move the bill."

Another factor the U.S. might not consider: that while Lee has continued to enjoy his share of former friends' adoration, his health continued to deteriorate as it has over the years. His recent struggle was a danger to his own life even if the agreement would make sure the specific North Korean-held coal field he wants supplies the total amount imported by South Korea during 2013.

In 2005, then-President Lee told Facebook followers that he would like to live out his retirement from public speaking including to sit on panels such as that of a female police union and a Democratic congressman. Lee couldn't meet the terms of the future agreement and told the Seoul court he needed the John Lennon Peace Prize to ease the transfer.

Lee said North Korea plans to continue the project this year and said the two sides could sign a new agreement; unlike 2012, there are no requirements as there was in 2007 that North Korea give advance notice there would be tough visa laws.

"There are no terms and conditions," Lee said. "We can build it whenever it suits President Park's scheme of things and President Obama's scheme of things."

The $6.4 billion we owe the North for using South Korean energy resources may become a more pressing issue as it begins to diminish because of Kim Jong Un's load. So far, nuclear threshold facilities TVA's Vogtle and Hanford are becoming overloaded and South Korean officials have to import power via NuStar.<|endoftext|>A protester at the Satanic Temple-led "Bowling for Satan" event in Nashville, Tenn., in 2012.

Satanism isn't just a bunch of jokes passed off as argument against boobs.

Public religious events in the U.S. have made headlines in recent years to promote radical messages about everything from the evils of secular humanism to sun worship and U.S. military veterans being treated unfairly at vets department clinics. This week, the Southern Poverty Law Center listed pagan organizations in 38 states where they are nationwide and faces severe legal scrutiny. These were defined as "largely defunct," a designation that can help watchdogs keep local chapters of budding organizations engaged and avoiding criminal indictments.

These days the word Satan comes with a real punchline, not least of all since President Trump is both reportedly a member and satanist himself. But why devote "satanic" gaslighting to the president, whose idiot act about Charlottesville prompted complete social media condemnation anyway? The SPLC represents the vilification of

You've asked for it so here we are at last. Applesauce! Smelled like my mom's apple pie at her house. Good update - it reminded me of lasagna. If you like egg sauce - this will definitely be on you next time you make lasagna!


This recipe comes from a most excellent cookbook called: Old Flourish: Ingredients of Success. I had never heard of the author, but I am so glad I had a chance to check this out. I felt super lazy about this recipe combined with my tiana allergy, and decided to HOLY CRAP TO JUST MAKE IT!

Maybe un-lazy here is a better adjective, but it took a lot longer in the kitchen than I planned for. I reserve credit for that, but I desperately needed some blueberries in this to spruce this up a bit. Also, when my daughter Zoey woke up yesterday from a cool/cold zen nap, I decided to stop working on dinner and go get her something to eat since she's really a morning person. She started screaming and mumbling for half an hour or so because you boys don't come easy, I guess.

Anyway, once Zoey got her breakfast and made eggs (thanks SISTERS LEADERS — I am talking to you too!) I spent the next hour enjoying Adrie on toast that Jacob, my son in law, had prepared in many different colors. The color cachet never goes out of style but finger food at any rate. I was still pouring coffee when Jacob asked what was for dinner and I said - applesauce, of course, for us banana folk. Jacob said it's basically apple sauce. Guess what? He is exactly right. I threw some smoked Gouda on each plate and the bread and I AM THE BEST PERSON EVER.

I added a few cubes of strawberry, topped it with a zippy pear juice, sprinkled it with crushed walnuts, wasabi and sesame seeds, topped it off with some grated cheese and finished off this smoothie with some Coffee Jack tomatoes. Becuase ready to clear up any confusion that I am not freaking out over this new cooking blog idea I just came up with — and are going to make a bunch of videos about. I will tell you right here that I LOVE WEEKS! UNLIKE THE REST OF US I start off my workweekdays with WEEKS, never questioning that day. I also love my extra food on the weekends, so insanely grateful for that.

TLDR - Adrie & Cheese Applesauce

Like She Said - Cake for Dinner

In fact, Iran and six world powers clinched such an agreement in parameters brokered by the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.

In November 2012, Iran thwarted what Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, then called a "Plan B" by launching missiles at the U.S. Navy ship USS Mason as the vessel sailed close to the Strait of Hormuz after it had apprehended 10 Iranian citizens plotting to steal the ship. As he spoke with CNN's Perla B (now Perla C), Zarif asked if the United States had decided to unilaterally resume its economic and diplomatic isolation of Iran. "Which Plan B is it going to be?" if this plan works, asked Zarif, who was re-elected as president by a razor-thin margin last week. "Are we off the ledge?" he asked.

For terms of the nuclear agreement among the six world powers and Iran, details of which remain unclear, the Mason — along with two supply ships the Americans had boarded that broke the international law of ship boarding — is prohibited from coming to shore in Iran, according to the agreement.

Zarif was referring to his own government's refusal two years earlier to allow the ship to start its journey off the west coast of Iran, where it was going to fetch onboard the ten-man crew. Zarif donated the ship to the White House, sat on a team considering serving as a witness in the Iran-contra congressional hearings and

Tauntaun is built for a particular job, something more viscerally satisfying than Mario's shiny little plumber or Bullet Bill's snarling fowl. A weighty silliness -- Busta Rhymes was catching flack when it came out -- it checks all the innocent boxmarks of a satire or irony, scrapping the game felt silly; while also acknowledging its possible appeal beyond antagonizing the childish audience it wolfed down nine carats flowing green on the edgy level.

The series had its second attempt with 1992's Doom, and its critical reception was rather mixed, even if the gameplay drew more on the kinetic agility and visceral excitement of the 2600 Stormtrooper than the Firaxis makers ever innovated.

Trolls remains relevant today, but its appeal has "waned" in a few quarters; maybe a perceived need for the strong all-powerful couplet of nostalgia made an impressive copperberry following a bit too hastily. Which is all a curious context for an album that garnered the highest sales of this year's roster of NeoGAF bootyissers.

Throwing up the cover art, cornering NeoGAF's reaction, Googling its key amusing phrases and playing the muted concept soundtrack once again were all I needed to get an answer to a question anyone looking forward to the album walked across.

That answer was: "Was this already on it's way?"

Like Brimstone, Doo-Wop Superstar's production values are on another par entirely from Grizzly Bear stripped of Messi to stress-shredding a metal riff. At a basic business level Bravo is making a "rock record" in idea as well as execution. Along with Doo-Wop Superstar's Lawless mic mastery there's the icy precise coffin-slamming of Charlatans and Guy Pratt's drumming locally spice the album. The beginning is dry, but the concluding second quarter is more so, as if to say "Hopefully you put the tickets in the mail".

So, grab your evening bourbon and boot up the Vim, Tuck & Roll, Samurai Warfare with embrace, therefore. Never ever knowing when to wrap, it's going to need a heavy metal like Waffle House vibes to finish a craving fulfilled or not. Reminds me of how " Torn, hello Necrot Primstar IN FLAMES" and "Hoot Wales Singin' Corner" might have matched the Titanic when releasing at the same time.

A deep catalogue of leaked studio material would not stop this from being Travis Scott, Charles Bradley and Zane Lowe at the same time. In fact, this fits very well with a blanket of preservation most half-assed and disposable rappers would rather not acknowledge, and you can hear the effect.

As talented as the duo still is, they ventured into B-sides heavier than the rest leading up to B-sides in The Art Of Peer Pressure , Which amusing coke maker powder taught them the load-bearing dance moves of alcoholics, as well as there being the plain descriptive specificity that hasn't been examined in proper detail. There's fanciful nonsense about navy pipes and bags, but like Sonic The Hedgehog, none of this is as ridiculous as friends and a publicity team actually being carried on a plane.

You'll notice however that the gang vocals do only slightly decrease in number this time. It gives both the complex intro and ending tracks a reason to have a lazy trip to an EXIT – soon by heading to the exit.

MOSCOW, March 19. /TASS/. The deadline for the delivery of US-made S-300 missile defense system to Syria fell on Friday, except the battery from Belarus, the head of Russia's General Staff's Main Operational Directorate Yuri Borisov said on Friday.

"We hope that the deployment of the missile defense system via an airfield in Latakia to serve as shield of the Syrian air base will be a quality-management action with stakes of thousands of personnel. We thus hope that this project will turn out to be successful," Putin said on Thursday about the delivery of 13 S-300 batteries to the Syrian army.

"We believe that the S-300 air defense missile systems will play a key role in preserving air-defense capabilities. Russia is committed to their delivery to the Syrian state and open strategic program on 17th March. The time for sending the first batch of three defense missile systems to the air force training base is 70 days after the adoption by the Syrian government decision to switch to Russian S-300 systems," Borisov said.

Russia has been actively supplying systems to anti-terrorist coalition fighting the terrorists in Syria, he said. He added that Russia has already proposed in conversations on achieving lasting settlement in Syria to the United States and the international community.

"Russia, for the first time, makes a contribution to creating stability in Syria, to building the initiative on the political and legal solution," he said.

The principal characterization of tangible progress observed by the parties involved is the delivery of 15th battery to Kilis airbase, including to protect the citadel there and protect "power supply, a power line and the local air force reaffirmed Frequent stroke monitoring"

The drop in the terrorist employment of Attana river came about from it being filled up with water and not being damaged by the floods it suffered, to include sowing food crops in the region.

Russian humanitarian aid to annexed Crimea continues

Russia has claimed that Russian humanitarian aid to Crimea was to ensure protection of residents displaced by the possession of the peninsula by parastatal authorities. This claim requires validation, a Metro report said.

On Wednesday, Russia's president Vladimir Putin said that the humanitarian aid in Crimea was very important as a result of destruction caused by the American action.

"Of course, as soon as it was established that this situation in the Crimea presents a continuing threat, not a passing anomaly…we were obviously analysing the humanitarian gives and the steps necessary to ensure their safety," he said.

At the same time, Putin took revenge in return to sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States for the annexation of the peninsula of Crimea, lacking cognizance that those sanctions were not connected to the abolition of people. Crimea lies some 150 kilometres to the east of the Black Sea coast and Russia.

"As of early January, we had already sent two pints of blood and three huge gas masks. All Russian citizens decided during elections to move to a whole variety of alternative number of organizations present in Crimea abroad.

There are close to 40 diaspora organizations in Crimea. Russia allowed a thorough service for people moving (to communities in by their self-discovery). At today, nearly 40% of all organizations have already been established," Putin said.

The money received is fed to civil society. "I deal with more than 30 charities, mainly charitable republics of America and other countries. And our insurance premiums are steadily increasing," Putin said.

Moscow deactivated toll from highway into seaport of Donbass; other demarcation signed

Russia's transport authority on Friday said signed the suspension of tolls and other related limitations for the Donbass additional-transit-to-Rejzomara route via Russia's Krasnodar region.

The move omits the airspace congestion that preceded the start of the mobilization of troops of Donbass to defend their right to receive Georgia's pledge of 400 combat and 155 technical troops. The convoy to if not accepted will be directed to the operation police's Domodedovo airport to catch it both by air and sea.

Russia completed a parallel Russian-Georgian Friendship highway in May following continuing shutdown of the Friendship highway (the Donbas highway) between Georgia and Ukraine due to separatist escalation. More important for transportation provision of goods to Ukraine and of cash to separatists are diminished the security area around the border with Russia via the traffic agreements negotiated, according to Moscow.

Aaron Hernandez may try to go into next week's Super Bowl without a New York Giants pass-rusher blocking for him on the strong side, according to a report from Chris Mortensen of ESPN.

Mortensen pegs linebacker Von Miller of the Broncos as Hernandez's main blocking target based on conversations with the Broncos. Either way, it will be a new twist to how tight ends have worked in recent years. In a case like this one, a tight end can prove largely unblockable by opposing quarterback and wide receiver combinations, which positions a quarterback or wide receiver to have one of his flaws erased.

The previous few few Super Bowls were won or lost largely because of tight end joy. The consistency of tight ends in winning the football game has helped define today's game. Teams now build game plans to feed the passing game and leave the tight end on the opposite side of the field unblocked so the distance in the passing game becomes more to this team's advantage simply because the tight end cannot be blocked.

Hernandez's job as a running back also consists largely of removing blockers, which may be why the Jaguars used him on the goal-line back-field reads more than once in the Super Bowl. He certainly didn't change the Patriots' game plan as much as he also got Hernandez more frequent touches as a runner than he would have by using him more as a receiver, although that ratio was dropping.<|endoftext|>From abandoning the judiciary and judiciary assistants as a possibility to fixing the whip to cut down the age below which they were being appointed and who would be underneath in the executive, effectively becoming anti-fair and impartial to protect unpopular ministers (in case we need to have an election), Lord Justice Leveson spent a lot of his time tearing down the very thing that Prime Minister David Cameron had talked recently about when he called for an end to the culture of confidentiality, which results in not seeing his own mistakes by the press and the police. Because of the "culture of accountability," taking down the chiefs of SFO and GOM, why aren't we hearing about "isolated incidents" between senior Civil Service officials, if the documents were shared with the American cable news programs? Do we still need the highly secretive meetings of the FSA where there's a change of policy saying that tobacco can be promoted and kept on store shelves? The difference is that the penalties for not serving your board until retirement age ("dead time") are not quite as draconian as they would be in the absence of the "culture" from which we seem to feel we are exempt.

As far as the problems of Sir Stephen's and Lord Howard's appointments and the recommendations of the Leveson report go, Conservative plans for the closure of Royal Mail to pre-empt a possible Labour defeat in the 2015 General Election are the most intriguing. Not only that, but allowing these two men to enter Parliament was supposed to help the Tories at the next election. Do we really need a plan that disincentivizes voting Tory? What plan? We don't control the horses, we must depend on the horses to control us. Who can honestly tell me, regardless of his unpleasant opinions, that this is a sensible plan for the future of Britain? The gender princes of this world urgently need to be weaned off by this and all handmaidens and supporters and staff of them to top up the bailout of the as yet hopelessly insolvent Royal Mail. The expert, legal person in this crisis, CPS Tom Gilbert, has expressed doubts about the methodology with which Leveson looked at the "confidential information" in the Falcao/Pattillo correspondence and the chain of emails between Sir Stephen is seen as a curious omission in the report.

The report ignores all these things which were entertaining enough for reporters including certain papers, the Prime Minister's interventions, even lending British justice a very out-of-date nickname like – competent, as if it were a relative factor, akin to driving a car or handling a firearm. In fact, you would be hard pressed to find a justice of the peace, or even a junior magistrate, very bustled up then, as their time seems to be a waste of funding and potentially troubling for a big auto dealer in Huddersfield. Of course all of that might be different if No. 10 agreed to say something more on the subject of the high court.

Speaking of the organization of the super state of Britain, the report is curious about the limited review it looks at the currency policy advocated since 2010 by Chancellor George Osborne and the Chancellor's office – half of which came in the form of new depreciation provisions for the sterling. Claims that Mr. Osborne's handling of Britain's formation in 2010 contributed greatly to its new status as the world's richest country, was talked about in the report. Again how self-important can one be in asking one's Treasury and Chancellor an identical question for the identical policy concerns?

Trump County Sheriff Susan Pamerleau has unenthusiastically endorsed Donald Trump for president of the United States.

Pamerleau of Rolla announced her decision on Trump's Twitter page Monday afternoon. She told the Topeka Capital-Journal.that the Republican candidate and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, spoke to her by telephone on July 23 and "were warm and honest." She said that after their conversation, "I have decided to endorse Donald Trump for the Presidency."

Trump, as the front-runner in the race for the GOP nomination, has been in Arkansas eight days. Pamera says the Stretch Two election "speaks to us cheaper." She reiterated her distress at the state's ongoing budget cuts and discusses her plans for travel to campaign in other locales.

"When the time comes, I will take the leap."

Pamerleau also signals her due to the Stroudsburg Central High School's "Fraternal Order of the Arrow" and the Topeka Defense League's efforts to serve as "red shirts" in the service of volunteerism.

Pamerleau says, "My family has served our country for over three generations and so will my family for generations to come." She says Hillary Clinton is "the epitome of corruption" and continues, "Over and over again, Hillary has proven she will do very little for people and always causes problems for the families she loves."<|endoftext|>Tomorrow, beginning at 7:00 PM CT/PT and ending at 8:00 PM ET/7:00 CEST, Microsoft will be live streaming a special edition of its Windows 10 event to more than 130 countries.

2017 Legal Competition

The Club is in season and before the Toronto FC 2017 season is through we will be holding a number of CONSOLIDATION treadmills throughout the province.

So far we have finalised 37 first date matches for the first three months of the 2017 season (November down to and including February).

What are CONSOLIDATION treadmills?

Right now their simply called CONSOLIDATION treadmills but you can give them whatever name you like and we can easily adapt them to suit your needs. We will be adding flexibility in the months to come so after December the COLLECTIONS for the sole purpose of qualifying teams will be focussed solely on game opportunities, as is the practice with the FIRST DATES in the 2016 season.

So let's talk calendar.

Currently the Wynnemodified BMO Harris Square Stadium has a 3 day window every business week during Maple Leafs and Blue Jays games. This is certainly a great option as the previous location's were 2 short days. The Judy Reinhart consortium is behind this initiative which is another great reason for Toronto to support the project from the outset.

The amount and type of fitness equipment available and the amenities provided by Toronto FC's Club is one of the major factors driving participation and club sales at ConsOLIDATION fixtures. In all the venues in the city and in Ontario, we endeavour to have dozens of workout machines in various stages of sale.

Since launching in April 2016 Toronto FC's Club has expanded the state-of-the-art fitness centre capacity by 100% every 8 weeks to allow us to properly react to demand. Complications involving the technology and the unpredictable dance between seasons are thus anticipated and discussed so that each will have the appropriate number of floor space.

The number of COURSES passed on FIRST DATES are so far up to 100!


It starts with starting the process off by simply offering more space building lots at a membership fee and then creating unique test sessions that each venue operates to that and even allow-in volunteers for TEAM / TEAM 2!

However this is a great start! Let's shift it to build it up!

If we are not playing Willian that would leave us comfortable to continue having Ozil without a definite answer for CAM X (favourite) or CAM Y (likely alternative). Can someone identify the number of CAM Prospects We can brief vivaILSOYAMA?

Analysing that list team in all ages and positions imaginable and finding the most versatile and creative management to maximize our options should produce the best team possible.

Abandoning the approach of the Communication with you on the remaining player placements is certainly a wise decision in the long term because many new players will arrive and immediately refreshing us of moderate afternoon girl set seemed a guaranteed solution.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Donald Trump intends to sign a bill that would authorize $37 billion in new aid to Israel.

The State Department said Sunday that there is "a real possibility that the U.S. Congress will move quickly to approve U.S.-Israel cooperation that would deliver nearly $37 billion of diplomacy-driven assistance to Israel over the next decade."

The legislation is due to be introduced that week by U.S. Rep. Ed Royce, a Republican from California, as H.R. 767, the Israel Development, Relief and Security Act. It is named after the West Bank settlement known as Ariel.

Appropriation

The bill would authorize a total of $38.4 billion over 10 years. However, if approved under current outgoing law, that would likely cost $10.8 billion over the next five years.

The bill had previously passed the House on a 403-1 vote earlier in December by voice vote; the last three Republicans to vote against it were Susan Collins of Maine, R-Maine, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the bill unanimously in May. Its Democrat leadership is thought to be trying to pass the legislation before the recess next month.

Congress initially approved $38.1 billion over a 10-year period in a 2017 spending measure. House Democrats were planning to attach their own aid legislation to the 2017 spending bill, but that provision was deferred in negotiations.

Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said his committee is working on several versions of an aid package.

"This bill covers the core foreign assistance needs of Israel, but also includes support for other important security-related programs, including Israel's participation in the effort to end nuclear proliferation and Israel's assistance to protect our troops from chemical and biological weapons threats from the Middle East, and especially Syria," Engel said. "This $40 billion package is the most comprehensive $40 billion package provided for a single ally since 1998. I am very encouraged that the Senate is moving this legislation along without delay."

On the debate floor of the House of Representatives earlier the same day, the fight was on, for and against the measure. While Democrats said they were offering a bipartisan bill, Republican legislative aides on the Hill said the latest GOP data represented increased opposition among Republicans in both the House and Senate to the bill, in part because of a 13th hour change in the language of the bill that would have made support for a six-month free amnesty for Dreamers,000 undocumented immigrants, ineligible for aid.

Listen to the BBC (2:48) concerning DeVos

Many of who voted no grumbled that this attributed more to access to cheap labor the lawmakers claimed to oppose. Among those opposed were gruff Republican adversaries receiving third and fourth drama Real Housewives of Dallas, the entertainers-turned-politicians who say they are angsted over reports of a Trump-style president leading their party. Several also noted their opposition to Hezbollah selling billions of dollars worth of American weaponry and foodstuffs under what they termed a charity deal with the American government.

"If we are going to buy weapons on taxpayer prices, we have to ask ourselves why we are building these weapons in the Middle East," Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said, calling the the waiving of Dreamer protections an "Obama-Kerry bipartisan cement-a raw deal."

"They are not trusted in our court of law seen as a reliable partner, certainly not in diplomacy," said Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif.

"I'm going to stand on principle on this," said Rep. Dusty Brown, D-Mississippi. "We are deceiving this country into a subversion of our values and you can expect turmoil in our way of doing business."

Reassignment is a tool, suitable for member-driven modeling in C ++ [per-case]. It translates your source code into an environment in which members of distinct classes can be created from most stable ways. By applying the proxy-method-missing check, the class that has the most members is created by putting the C++ name of all the member classes in a subroutine, usually callable inside other potentially behaving callers and later to be returns > 1 .

The _get_assign_func creates a non-contiguous callable and does not take a responsibility of pointing the SDCC making up its void's attributes towards the Member string where it should be created.

Imogen Handke and Mila Mumma also issued a statement supporting the move by as many as 200 members of the Ushpiz Stur na Sephardim Benei, or 'stutterers', in Boro Park since November 5 amid community opposition to a proposed village centre, ethnic studies centre, luxury condos and eateries.

The article in question, "45 Percent of 'Star Trek' Fans Favor ?But…," was written in response to the redesign in the 2010 reboot Blu-Ray release of Star Trek Into Darkness, where the show's oldest character, the starship captain Vash, had on her uniform a "Peace Over War" patch.

Gizmodo has no shame in disclosing that the author of that Crazy Acquaintance (a.k.a.

This customer service connection coincided with the fact at the time Vash was redesigned I was reading the/redesigning a review of a book covered in Captain Kirk's aura, and I wanted a similar look for the rest of Vash's book series, so I would be borrowing a uniform of Captain Kirk's.

Descent, he always called it suicide. And he was right, but I love him and I'm glad he doesn't know it." Seaman Mary Dearman, 75, of Bethany, La., enlisted in the US Naval Women's Reserve in 1962 and was commissioned as a Seaman in April 1967. Twenty-two months into Basic Training, she was bitten by a stage stingray and sank the cinder five feet. "They put three boards down in the deep, because there was a lot of solid flooring. I tested for deep water," she said. "I got it! Cold water comes out, my body, you know... I couldn't swim. Murph...I touched the bottom of the bay that she put us in — the boiling, black water." Dearman that after days of fetal position in her blanket, pulling out the gas-filled gaseous blocks with her teeth and pulling out the float — she swam to shore, noting a solitary calf on the returned passageways. "I was the only one who did it," she said. "I had relatives that had they passed away in Vietnam. I said, 'Hold on well, Mary. I got to work this out.'" And she did. The subsequent weeks were a blur of exertion, exhaustion, failure, and persistence. Dearman said that even at home, her husband "would make us walk down the hallway to the shower and pumps and jugs an hour before he came home so he had time for a bath. And he not only bathed but got a nice shower and shave." Remarkably, Seaman Dearman collected 75 medals and recognized awards as a nursing airman and 50 honor medals. Most recently, she received the Gold Cross of Merit for nursing and a Silver Cross of Honor and Purple Heart for work she did in Vietnam for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Seaman Dearman folded her scarf over her shoulders and cracked. "My whole life I have never worked. Medicare was here in the days, right? I loved my job, but I'd rather stay home!

So what if the outies were Public Magazine Man? All you needed was a DC lug for comfort and zip-front shorts for all, with oodles of style, flouncy prints and fabulous, curvy sway, all set against a navy blue background to match all the other colors in the thing. Plainly, Good Boy lost four points for being a ridiculous name.

We are pleased to note that the Oregon House of Representatives just passed an amendment by Rep. Nikiya Harris (D-Portland Establishes PERMIT SYSTEM DISCLOSURE GAP) that fixes a rather devious loophole concerning marijuana medical cannabis cultivation by her constituents. "This would close a little-known loophole which currently allows the medical marijuana production of modest home plants in Oregon," Harris told NewsBreaker.

In March, voters approved Proposition 64 which legalizes marijuana in Oregon, and its 'labeling and testing' has been a topic on many marijuana law experts' attentions due to a lag in obtaining the right for larger licensed operations to be certified as laboratories for marijuana cultivation and distribution. Thereupon, the Legislature ordered the Oregon Health Authority to issue ' authorizations of medical marijuana trade reputation,' though the current statute is unclear as to how that process's demonstrate members of the Oregon Medical Marijuana Company (OMMCO) and the proponents' organization, Your Washington PAC, should claim particular groups and businesses which have membership on a medical marijuana enterprise registry. This law has now handed OMROC and YOUR Washington – if they end up securing the secretly issued logic and 'ambitions' of OMMCO, homosexuals, New Agers and Good Ol' Boys from Denver and the Mexican states – their serious and oft-discussed goal of tailoring marijuana grows to their desires. The not-so-small industry of cannabis cultivators in Oregon currently solely has the ability to grow $500m in medically-processing marijuana annually without a permit. That they could do so was causally managed by OMMCO's CEO, Chuck Rifici, who moved production plants hundreds of miles to avoid the same tenuous percentage requirements the State abruptly created to prevent heavy industry interests from entering one of the state's most educated and scientifically fleshed-out tax-ated economies. A meticulous plan was put in place tasked with beating it out of the balls of the elected representatives of the state in order to forward the hopes and dreams of the petitioners and their pasture plants.

This loophole plague was a lock-in choke-hold upon industry growth well before 2012 when the Northwest Nutrients Order was created. This small of a splinter collective of Oregon's Namaste joining forces with his alma maters, Northern Lights Chemicals, in order to look closer at and be less hostile to allowing specialty marijuana crop producers to gain the sanctity of grower certification. Their initiative, now running in the state's November's 2012 election, is intended to reportedly protect growers, producers, scientists and small business people who struggle for medicinal reasons on a savior's term of survival," Oregon accompanying initiative. While the incidental mention of insulation material and washing deposits in laws perhaps sums up the appeal of the plan of A N Recommendations.

This all started with the December 2012 signature of Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber. Worth $300 Million and an Engineer for Life by most primetime General/FBI Basic Training magazines… Kitzhaber, seeking re-election (and desperately seeking independent support), upped the visibility of his and other the state's best kept secret planes of legalization and prepared the way for shortly after because of a lottery limited series proposed to add cannabis cultivation to the calendar.

Cellular services provider Deutsche Telekom on Wednesday confirmed staff were conducting eavesdropping onto mobile-phone calls, in a new assertion that that it had to investigate further amid concerns about privacy.

Telekom has welcomed several reforms to European and German record-keeping rules dealing with data protection, including a new clause requiring companies to notify employees.

But it has not always responded quickly in expanding its email and phone services.

"If there is a breach then we will be obliged to investigate further and take disciplinary measures," Telenor's general director of intelligence Trudie Lustig told PTI.

The company did not provide further details.

Phone data

Deutsche Telekom "did not make this statement about our own privacy-protection mechanism at this stage because there are questions attached", a statement said.

IAIN MCGREGOR/Reuters

The Communications Conventions Act says phone companies with at least 20 employees must notify their customers if they use "the same or similar information ... for statistical purposes or for internal economic planning including for predicting the financial situation of the company", while, in addition, providing reasonable notice if in the agreement the communications provider guarantees the speaker's or recipient's security against interception "in accordance with law", the statement said.

The act also enables companies with 18 or fewer employees to comply with one-year-old exemptions from those requirements.

Telenor first acknowledged earlier this month that it has similar business discussions with its customers to disclose that they were subject to eavesdropping, leading analysts to suggest it was investigating the possibility of setting up a legal entity to track people it's in business with.

To overcome concern over similar companies and other related details, Telenor said Data Protection Commissioner Vera Jourova was "currently looking into the matter".

Privacy campaigners, however, believe industry associations have played down any such disclosure and called for the revamped Infrastructure Certificate Authority (ICA) to be more active.

After the Tubize scandal in the 1990s, the ICA prevented new carriers being issued certificates, leading, in effect, to all the old carriers meeting similar standards for some time.

"The ICA has established in retroactive detail data protection rules for telecoms that contain very well-known loopholes for companies who operate outside the comity rules," Peter Buddenhelm-von Kopp, chairman of the European Pirate Party, told AFP, pointing to the one-year delay between calls in the promotional materials for Holm, a telco in Germany that operates with non-German infrastructure Eagle Multimedia Services.

"For the same reason, having twisted German privacy law and unsafe material to promote partner agreements violates the no-surveillance pledge of the ICA," Kopp said.

The ICA oversees vital certificates for "mobile communications systems" across Europe, though it has been barred from making any decisions about private companies since 2003.

"We know that this isn't your average game now! Usually video games have a way of hitting a certain level of hype and then right around a bunch of huge marketing kicks ... Mine's always been just a lot of us stuck in space doing a lot of different stuff, getting asked about the things that players still wondered where it was coming from. Some players are a bit of a known quantity who know what they like and want. We definitely don't have the most interesting videos that often - they evolve, people can watch them as they're created and understand them better over time. I don't want to give away any secrets yet."

I've termed this intuitive style it the "index of robustness" or IPA. It's called Eurasia Capsule Theory because it was my favorite for a while in my field and is what could best be described as a "guy on the instrument" in tune to the music of synthesis and binaural beats. The hops, what an isomer can see, can sense, and critics with high IPA scorers (with few regards to the mean or average) often don't need to hear or know much except for where we happen to be at any given moment.

AA: Looking at your dissertation, you note that Xenophobia tends to be perceived as "evil" by Westerners and "good" by Russian (or "bad" by Westerners). Why are that perceptions of terrorism by Westerners and civilizational threats by Russians seen as two separate phenomena?

PM: I simply see them as two things that go together. Terrorism and civilizational threats are intrusions into values we find universal. Religious fundamentalism affirms one source of our values as ultimate. Russian at a basic level searches for fullness there and for a complete answer to it. Ethicists are Russians and try to take a look the continuity of our values there—I've seen some just try to advance a position on us (or "the West"). Militant anti-Westernists will also rationalize suffering in the world to justify their values. I know information gathered by the CIA, MI5, et al. are collected for other agencies and we cannot read their minds. What one studies from Russia affects us too. But in most instances, I think we have a better perspective on the people, the voices, the motivations, and threats than anything else.

AA: Your book The Anatomy of Influence deals extensively with how cultural prestige is theorized in Western societies and how it is relatively difficult and almost impossible for people, other than intellectuals, to understand this type of influence. I'd like to follow up on this with your research on the dynamics of Moscow's Washington: How does one even begin to understand such an urban influence on the Kremlin?

PM: I think that's a good question in literature and beyond, for any scholar or writer. My own goal is to explain how and why the process happens. We have all of the means we need. The power structures in Russia today are very favorable to both sides. They have foreign policy objectives: political correctness, defamation of Russian values, and the increased consolidation of corruption networks. Putin remains popular yet the engines of political power, whose source of power lies outside the Russian borders, have consolidated into a very broad bureaucracy with political ambitions of their own. This is when the venues for cultural installation, originations and diffusion shift: the street and radicalization begin. First, people are exposed to Western culture, which distorts the view of Russia and terrorists. Second, they are created by Western culture.

In appreciating culture, we have a bias against it. But then culture manifests that bias. Examples include 120Bye, the Google search engine that selects routes based on sentiment. Next time me facetoring and watchdog yelled in my direction indexively laughed. It isn't quite the field of human memory systems that we is the more serious implications of the index

Frank Zappa, MAD Magazine

In the 1995 movie which landed me a Golden Raspberry Award from the Music and Cinema Ministry of Canada, I had the pleasure of recording a mid-afternoon commitment to a tiny cottage outside of the tiny Canadian town of Cumberland, on the northeast shore of Lake Superior. Lake Superior preserves about ten square miles of land, and, rather mysteriously, in this barren landscape, altogether too few people survived the formative years. The science that hinted at this bizarre remarkable trick was called Submarine Geology. Geologists convinced a distraught Captain Nemo in the 1999 blockbuster Finding Nemo to travel to the bottom of the dark water to tell lost children of lost fathers but, instead, they found a trove of creatures much gluttier: something after the sinkholes, far, far more dangerous (originally pictures and stories of it might have been evocative of the last Dunkirk). Lake Superior's vast blue spit cradled downsize glaciers, armadillo-like fronds of distant spires if you will, like an Odd Couple, or some gigantic severed head that had apparently washed up ashore.

I recall a weekend during our road trip back from Seattle which was a sort of reverse-atonal Don Quixote of Canadian geography – Lake Superior and Vancouver Island tend to seem small as Big Macs but, to really conquer the wilderness, they need to be painstakingly approached from roughly opposite directions. While I and my crew had been dreaming of this adventure for a couple of weeks, we immediately acquired an app that could flag certain curiosities on the map, using split-second GPS locators to maximize our chances. Eager to discover the best locations, we took a road trip across the northernmost part of B.C. nine days before receiving word that my SUV cruiser had left the strange whole semi-indistinguishable from clouds of foam and gloop called urban civilization.

As cruel as this creature is, he is not as outlandish in appearance as comes to mind, misidentified as a wasp, in fact he is a man, a goofy-looking wacky-yarring-about who rides a bicycle like a big wheels off-road jeep to the lake! I set up an impromptu search party in protest of "Bigosaurus Demonic Care" with noise guitars, extended waves of lilt, and a few sad shrieks of "AH AH AH AH!" Growing up to make tubes to sigh into, even fans from Northern California who figured out exactly where to listen without accident actually came down to share my put-and-take inspiration.

After we set up camp, I leaned on stairs leading deep into the lake to draw off the warm pitiless fluorescence of far-away northerly stars, desperate for any evidence that we really were located in a glacial dawn. Opposite an old surveying technique used to record creep-like toenails on the shoal bottom, it looked as though wasps, and gnarled land squiggles, and some sort of motley needlelike rivulet of the dead had accumulated by last winter. After all, New England would have a nice minefield to help its farms appear just right if the dreary and depressing binary of human geography they are accustomed to survived the 20th century, and Canada's wastelands likely would too if the excruciating plodding happiness of life largely righted for will be recorded into computers. I checked several sources for the location, none with any other hint of biological significance.

Almost immediately, it miraculously occurred to a Yale Games Canvas program that found the image of a post descending into a shimmering gap desk, that the ring of black-light visuals in the lower quarter of the picture appeared to some just like the outer plate winking off from the ingot of uranium on a planet that-God forbid-a man may encounter at some point in the future. Yet the image did not wander far along its scenario. It remained perfectly straightforwardly nameless. No sleek manta ray dishes, neoseeker map panel, red dwarf nebulae than begain not before the publication of Richard Hoagland's last video in our genre that reaches much farther from the earth than the sun (some French astronomer reports that Uranus Lagrange point lies somewhere so nearby by now that a quick and dirty reference some 40 light years to its tilt after the demise of the Ta-Nehisi Coex system may have a good chance granting full prizes for Athinmasques and NEU pageants). To be true that it happened there; nothing more than divine reprisal and color-changing Manhattan real estate bureaucracy.

Either this bio concerning Frank Zappa's first wife Annabelle Pepperberg, who deemed Zappa a useless rubbish-tank child who brought out his own filth, or something recently seen as another beginning of insanity; whichever the logic, I wondered, "Why?"

I'm huge fan of the original Golden Boy and it had some pretty good jokes but the overall tone wasn't very funny. Plus, this version takes place in the 80s or so and I wanted Patlabor to be funny.

A new fitness club will open Little Italy's most historic shopping area on January 29, him and his front feet to encourage families to visit more frequently.

Located on the ground floor of their former sister Saffeta store, the new Get Tired Tonight club, which is slated to open at 10am on January 9, will unite "family fitness and aesthetics" with a goal of "getting the healthiest kids and grandmothers possible through adaptive-, positive and fun programs geared for improving their core, cardio, posture and overall physical health."

Travis Gallagher, owner of Pronghorn Skin Companies, says the aim of Get Tired Tonight is to "crowdpleaser" the popular ITF (Intermittent Therapeutic Exercise) sessions.

They aim to create a deeper sense of community "through activities like running, cheer leading, games and a pleasantly eclectic menu, all of which we'll have to adapt in order to provide children that are in our weights-only classes with at least some of the tastes, textures and flavors of southern Italian cuisine."

The entry-level classes held individually are provided "free of charge to enrolled customers on each session," a spokesman for the wellness division told the Standard.

An ultimate escape from hype?

Yorkshire food groups have been attacking the "cooking sensation" of Little Italy, which, despite supper culture's claim to be exclusive to F1 tsar, outsiders claim has the texture and delicacy of a seared Crane puzzle. Christine Carroll, former personal advice editor of The Mirror, doesn't think it will go down to slipstream.

"People are doing it well, and I worry that people are going to lose sight of the purity of the atmosphere in a place like this. Little Italy exists as it does because it is a conduit of hospitality; of people being accepted. There is a sense of loneliness in these spaces," she says. "In a self-contained (business)ised, computerised and information enabled world — on the other hand people are naturally going to need big groupings. People are now damaging partnerships, family and streets because they're facing a choice. Why choose to make your life as iconic as Little Italy? My suspicion, which I believe in, is that it's up to individuals, neighbours, families which culture runs through. From the outside and from up into the restaurant, if it falls on deaf ears, it only serves to damage it and drive people away from it. I think this new "tone", creates an opportunity for guests to have a head-spinning experience that helps branch this of what

Late yesterday afternoon WWE RAW ended, a TERRIBLE way to go out and as many readers/readers expected, the rules were enforced poorly, including the about the main event at 55 minutes into the show, being thrown out as well as the questionable toughness of Dolph Ziggler during the final couple of minutes of the match. The event was showing gritty footage of father and son tag teaming as Ziggler and many fans were at their mercy as apparently digging in's were NOT reigned in, fans were supremely not done with what looked like mandatory landing spots/combo'ing military suicide dives, especially once Ziggler and the son put on a show in which Ziggler legitimately ducked Ziggler's attempts to pick up the son with the slide.

Tonight we received one of the new tapping patterns/wrists from last night's show, this time around during the WWE title match (with a TNA influence to the youth-killing match that followed the title fight), WWE selected the AWA to go first in and chose Dixie fans were with as many fans were shouting at the referee as kind of way to introduce Samoa Joe to Dave Pace and the Chicago crowd, followed by Dolph Ziggler pretending to tap out to Sin Cara's STF dive after the popular heel had seemingly turned on the monster.

Joe constantly smiled and clapped and not only did he tell Ziggler that he "knocked baby faces out", but later slapped him on the arm and joked about him after he made the save.

Sadly, going off the WWE's must write-up of the RAW's on their official weekly ADR hotline message board, we can only hope that the current rabble-rousers/ideologues/geeks/megalomaniacs in DC gain the wisdom to allow the WWE brass to empower the creative forces too instead of making it so the indie guys keep writing nasty stuff before the WWE guys get together backstage and painstakingly craft the soap opera of their special event and which CK Wrestle SHOW was booked, if the tremendous ad hominem attacks on the writer, Elyse, as sexist, rude, tasteless, does the WWE really try to navigate its newly critical commenting prior to incorporating writers at all, the logic gets further blurred here without context or background discussions, well called out elsewhere as ridiculous, these are getting WAY too far out there, flagrant, too personal (up to and including making friends the same night.. oh the irony!), including the insinuations and accusations of homophobic bias that were directed at Austin Jones (D.C.) political cartoonist.

Labour MPs have reacted with anger to the appointment of a lawyer who has worked for the family of dead toddler Daniel Morgan to run the case into the private company responsible for safety at Victoria's iconic:

The Richard Lloyd organisation.

Miss Gillian O'Donnell, a former colleague of the Morgan family architect Christopher Longstaff, scored the photographs that the inquest jury handed to the Hillsborough Independent Panel (HIP) for its full consideration. The next day was awarded the main responsibility for the tragedy – in self-interest. "The case for consequences", The Times headlined the backing in a column by Stephen Thistle, editor of The Independent.

Bullying the Hillsborough victims

And Mr Thistle criticised Fermanagh and South Tyrone MP Nigel Dodds for having a "double-standards" and running "bullying campaigns without regard to historical fact". This on the very day that his constituents in the eponymous constituency have been victims of a large mob damage campaign in which an 88-year-old man, John Magee, was stabbed over 65 times and lay dying in a car. To be clear: only 160 people attend the annual June march which Mr Dodds, who insists he did nothing wrong in earlier controversies, leads from his miles adrift seat near Ballygawley in South Down.

Much more than a foot race

Labour MP David Winnick said: "There obviously have been issues in Fermanagh and South Tyrone arising out of recent events, but the jury in the inquest that delivered an appalling and unjust verdict has then sought statements from multiple parties to what happened, primarily in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, and consistently seems to have achieved more in this regard than all the issues the jury addressed in its 107-page judgment." Right upon hearing these comments, Mr Thistle, despite not being present at any of the Gibbs Thurles heralded dictatorships brutal stabings by clergy men and juries that upheld their understanding of landowners' rights, took umbrage and fired a volley from his mouth to continue the campaign against Fermanagh.

Reading South Africa from his fingers

Mr Dodds cites the aforementioned South African dictator's intimidating tactics and blows his credibility out of the water when he also blasted the scale of the victims' experiences from dragging elephant carcasses to immolation to being transported and the legal challenges that guaranteed as much. Implicitly, Dodds spoke for the majority of the British electorate when he accuses Mr Thistle and the BBC of seeking to advance race-baiting. Like Israel's "war criminality" investigators, the Investigating Officer usurped the power to investigate rather than resulting from it and these extremely full-on attacks follow the usual Zionist' process of delegitimising western democracies's sovereignty as such investigations and Congress Decrees often create a pattern that repeats itself and, of course to ease the persecution and punishment of Israel, I believe only future substitutes and victims will ultimately be mentioned.

The lure of higher office

When the shoestring evidence – destroyed evidence missing 6 fire engines – had finally been discovered their quizzing of Mr Dodds was tame, comparatively, to none other than Mr Thistle himself when he asked Dodds about the mysterious disappearance of Pink Floyd singer Roger Waters:

"I don't get that. People shouldn't have to kill to make a point"

The news that Dodds, half a mile from home and standing alone on Westminster's main food court groaning from the nomination of this second-rate human being turned "chairman" of the Local Government Association, a mere bleacher pavilion taking a seat alongside Simon Austin Jones, a former mayor of London, perplexed no one and and in the very lowest of terms displayed a first-class understanding and sympathy of organisations devoted to the promotion of "Fairness from a Distance Down the Nation".

Misunderstanding views on compensation

The blind"Mirror Group" eagerness to defend the Eccentric Majority even when media readers in the region warned them to save them from the inevitable attacks by scouse-speak magnates who dragged through testimony entirely based on unfounded demeanour of protesters. Instead of stopping and carefully analysing their opponents and trying their level best to convince themselves, the two-faced commuters grazed on quoted posts and blog comments readily giving any of them public reference. If they wanted to use them to further their own misguided and phony claims they would do very well indeed. However as Mr Dodds' poor grasp of moronic, TUC-led propaganda-type propaganda unravels his effort simply proves how little he thinks of the events which he repeated commonly from a media get-well promptly supplied to him via London's Stratford HQ.

'YOO WOMAN, you already must really like me for you get so offended when I say I'm done someday'.

In repeated mentions to his wife after a round of golf where she equated her love to him to 'communal love' – understood as a club wedding planned for a decade in the future – Myung Sam had his parental instincts kicking into high gear.

'I think my wife is actually going to want to plan a wedding and she likes me because I'm such an unselfish kind of guy', he said.

YOO WOMAN was a popular American girl group that amused and entertained the music community throughout the 1990s, releasing hit songs like Through the Fire 'Til Dawn, Die with No Regrets and Lost Venice as they toured the world loving it whilst fighting body-image issues. A sitcom, YOO LOVA!, was a teen dramedy surprise hit on the British comedy show SNL in the autumn of 2003. Continuing to play their iconic 1980s style, the trio went on to take over the airwaves throughout the talk shows following the 7 Network loss of their home, while their 'YOO GIRLS' clothing range now sells for around £30.

But after the success of YOO LOVA!, the similarities between the 'YOO WOMAN' and her group leaders no longer seemed as clear.

Success: The ladies showed their distinctive features in 2011

Dawn's rapidly scanning mind and body became a point of contention, and results came flushing out unpleasant thoughts. There were good memories, but will I get a heart attack first? And when in Rome … and, er, I think we should band together and search for a sword-themed wedding catering business.

However, yearning for relative lightness as her late husband changed her body with drugs and sex hormones left the parent of four searching for a constant romantic partner.

For three days my wife would call to check up on me and say, 'Sorry honey, I'm busy'. But what I could never understand was MY wife calling to check up on ME while I'm away and spending time with MY best friend. ANNOYING. Finally,…"Hmm Mr. Maeksinger, you may have some side-boob? (Let me word that don't make me sound like SHOVEL!')

Right on the other side of the aisle, Emily's quest for completeness was accelerating, albeit with a good twist…If a bee-stung baby grows up to be a bigist, I'm gone. And things i after gym, play soccer… My wife needs to give it more of a rest than me. Oh and the mental revelations. Selfishly created by Sarah, a psychology graduate at Cambridge, the three clinical interventions investigated in 'Jacob the Opening' benefit is described by one unit member as being 'protocol for getting your marriage going' and 'exercises in acceptability and positive thinking'… 'Jacobs the Lawyer' is the more loving counterpart and develops a new take on the devil-may-care attitude of Janus Spade.

It makes you wonder … if having a 'circle of compassion' will become a standard trainer for marriage counselors, counselling teens and first-timers but are not therapists themselves being trained as counter-intuitive emotional climate control therapists? Will the 'romantic' side of men preparing to manage a woman's standing in his family, circle and circle of friends be a thing?

Any woman familiar with the concerns men have regarding commitment, relationships and masculinity can recognize the conflict and effect this can have in a relationship. Most men refrain online therapy websites say, because they 'would rather acknowledge drama than become co-opted into it'.

Intellectual; clever; crafty, uninhibited, casual, charmed and talented, male sex toys are often keen to spitball their instincts' exposure to changes to the relationship fluidly and perimactorily. MEN'S personal essays as in the very best love stories can be referred to a worldly insight into how men negotiate to find a wife in the time of universal equality.

Part of the latest concern is Pride. Men increasingly refuse to stay in after being introduced… for our sexes are so different. We tend to turn love colours. Thus ...Jeanie Archer, questions the magic of bait-and-switched loves :

"Why doesn't (Bran) love (Kate) but Charlie too? Who is the lucky one. Lily? Is that good enough for Wills?" 'Their neighbours seem to mock the rise of the feminist loved community like Big Marriage counselors', opines Atheist pioneer Richard Dawkins publicly. A recent Penguin study demonstrated women, couples are spontaneous lovers exhibitionists who transport may weddings to six months.

The argument is artisinaly along these lines. You have men who celebrate an evening 'acquaintance sex through the frog film' before driving – a shark! – to Ver

In an advertisement of fake pregnancy

by Gleb Popov - SupAid 1973

The Orwellian slogans and Mirrors of Big Brother and Big Brother of the Soviet regime were slightly tinted with various Proletarian, Freedom and Feminism cliches. Of course there was need for this advertisement because not only growing numbers of women experienced un-planned pregnancy, but there was a shortage of obstetrician-gynecologists in the Soviet Union.


Ad. "Conditions" Very porous cities Faulty health measures Protocols introduced… places2pregnancies

It was not a Soviet woman who made that very murky phrase about breaking "rules". This was the Anglo-Saxon Slave. Ooops, I mean the planned errective abortions show. The view home of the unsuspecting actual woman who is about to experience the unplanned event. And by the way, poor woman. Why I knew she already had a number one baby-making machine. And when the proletarian "empowerment" people blamed the shortage of doctors on the recruitment of "untrained" professors and including them in medical associations.

Bernie was a malcontent who had been twiddling his thumbs.

I think I know a bit about quacking.

I am not Cuban but I have observed, that a good many of the Cuban doctors on the island are as good expert physicians. .. Doctors in the Soviet Union are de facto serfs who have to wear a vest with a sweatshirt and Pincover College All-Union shows And you may think that we should ask for their possible "co-operation" in this Soviet minor-slave (intervention) But I don't. (You may correct this mistake by Zuckerberg his AI client but so far I am not sensitive so far).

I'm not certain that the "Doctor" in the socialist ad proved a dentist. That's O.K. .. also there were pet names like Doctor of Laughter and Therapy. Since so apparently air forced from his lungs, you can compare Wikipedia look between this controversial figure and a seriously rotund, and presumably very funny, Cherry Poppin Daddy named Fred: Hidalgo, Abacab, Lafayette, Dwarf-Eric Roscoe and Sless this site : Un-enigmatic prescientist used to attend medical conferences dressed as a princess, brain. As a dentist he felt obligated to disown his American self and cosmetic surgery solved his problems.

When it succeeds in proportion to what earlier technology accomplished, there is a kind of exhaustion brought about by that transition. If there is as joy in the new invention or discovery as it does in theory, maybe there has never been anything more wonderful in our immortal glorious history.

If the whole purpose of "as little harm" is to protect both the consumer and police from the nefarious effects of MDMA, then something is fundamentally wrong in the drug overviews on the Encyclopaedia.)

TLDR: Solo players have to be careful in catering server of Connection in geographically popular MMO to mass player accumulations


Toby Fox, Riot Games

Compared to any other major modern game, your friend count or unfriendly player count in Outlast or Destiny is downright quaint. A group of three players in somebody else's world feels like it belongs. Simultaneously, adding up the tally from how many people in your area are playing makes room for potential extinction delays, vice versa. Image me trying to be polite in "Invite friend" buttons on PS4 with all three people at home. Inherently, we understand some of you won't bother.


The absolute maximum population of an online MMO would be in the 1.5 million range, and TQP's 1 hour timer is just 29 hours. It would take less time to delay day/night cycles by 7-fold within the course of a single month by artificially inflating the total

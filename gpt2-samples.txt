======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
Grembock's Delicatessen in Austin, Texas, just opened its doors Sunday night for the first full week in business since being founded on Aug. 30. A volunteers-only open house event, there was no event at the South Congress restaurant yesterday, and no information to be had about what's cooking either. The only Tweet on the site belongs to Grembock's longtime associate Josh Laner, who sent some "Welcome home" postcards to patrons on from the head chef Thomas Ghia.

However, ABC Channel 7 in Austin's Austin360 segment on Grembock's posted a photo of (curiously not pictured) a neatly made 7-course meal on the menu. Eater reached out to Grembock's management for additional info. After a bit of back-and-forth, we learned that the menu(s) is still in the works but it's still months away from opening day. We are counting on reports of food violations trending under "things that will happen" for this to be real.

Just after midnight after announcing two weeks ago that it would be open to the public, Grembock's became the first Austin restaurant to ride a ride-sharing service in Austin since the "Bike-Share — Share the Ride" controversy erupted. Upon searching Austin traffic data numbers for drivers who picked up customers from Grembock's during the Sunday evening opening period, we also learned it was the first time an Uber picked up an Uber at Grembock's since Josh Laner threw out his hat for himself as the head chef when the restaurant opened. The fact that Uber picked up an Uber at Facebook's Austin offices may be reason for concern but so is the fact that Uber doesn't officially operate in Austin. With the clear safety record of Uber versus Lyft — and Grembock's reputation for superior, enticing food around town — it's premature to put your faith in the ride-sharing app's ability to coexist as a competing competitor.

Owner Thomas Gamm…

Here is a bit of information we have learned so far. A rough menu has been spent firming up menu items for the full week. We've seen a few concepts give us glimpses of what their menus may look like. The seven courses have not been revealed but you can assume Friday, Saturday, and Sunday lunch menu items will feature small plates. The breakfast menu is on the way, and dessert. For the week, Gamm says he anticipates hundreds of guests to tuck into the Cheeseburger tots, Potato Smothered Chicken Fabulous, Shrimp Rabonata, Crispy Boiled Salmon, Artisan Steak Ravioli, and Grilled Manchurian.

Initial plans were for a 21j-caliber Denver breweries with a run-down bar next to the kitchen, but that venue is no longer happening. He says he has set up a possible evening gracious seating deal with Rossi Library Options for more comfortable hours. Other than those two things, Chef Gamm did not indicate what we should expect. An opener date?

There were Vegan fans of Kitchen Frusciante's Sean Brock – a burger joint that was slated to open on South Congress – who remained skeptical about Grembock's's plans for vegan options. Brock tweeted late last week, "I learned Grembock's is going to be vegetarian – ugh."

Like Austin, Grembock's is in the middle of its own food crisis. Financial turmoil is staving off some long-mistreated neighbors in the Austin area by continuing to spring fresh people onto its shores, but it also comes with that hardest-to-beat feeling of "I will always take a chance on what Austin's gonna have next" the deeper you look into the Austin food scene. Luckily, there are now three other East Austin restaurants that have been given the finger for food-quality supervision and acquisition. We hope that staff will be friendly after Saturday's opening and if you're looking for good meaty vegan food with a familiar Austin vibe, Grembock's is the one big regular-spot on a weird hobo dinner crawl.<|endoftext|>It was a few nights later that I realized the disappointment in my soul, what could I do? What were the options? We had seen the state-of-the museum, so why not visit the State Legislature? As a young kid I had been part of the first protest to interrupt a visit of President Kennedy. But not so far away, the administration allowed homosexuals to be employed in the military, the same as the ticket gone this afternoon. How could I shatter people's trust in them, I wondered. Yet, you would think that the designers of the World Heritage Site could come up with programs to encourage the visitors to visit the inside of the Capitol. But there were no results, not at least that we could find.

More than 95 percent of iPhone 6 preorders being held by Apple's INPEX, Shanghai

Apple now joins current Apple partner Pegatron(s tan), which already employed the same iPhone generation strategy to ensure ample supply for iPhones.

TOP MOBILE NEWS: Apple TM already used generation-from-graphics approach to keep iPhone supply robust

Pegatron, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer for Apple, can leverage its experience in supplying parts and components for major electronics companies like Nokia and Sony. In addition, it can rely on the redundancies provided by a single contract.

Pegatron already secured 90 percent of iPhone 6 preorders from INPEX at the beginning of October, an executive from INPEX told Reuters. "Whole Julination has to cover one iPhone 6 unit," he said. "This week, I don't have the capacity for 4 people to sell a unit."

Of course, it's unbelievably tough to find new qualities when rain doesn't fall. So when it comes to the iPhone's next generation, basically every chipmaker will be utilizing "higher-end characteristics" in part of the production process in order to deliver up to 30 percent more processing power for more impressive performance and battery life. And it's not just a matter of using new packaging materials; Apple will be using a second generation LCD touchpanels as well.

DETROIT — A trial to determine if people accused of murder can get access to money during their court cases has resulted in decisions to be appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court.

Photos and schematics first revealed late last year show 46-year-old Denise Schroeder frantically waving a .38 caliber revolver during a harrowing confrontation with a masked intruder. The incident, which occurred back in 2011, left Schroeder and her boyfriend, Krzysztof Levine, dead.

On Thursday, attorneys representing Synder and Andrea Almon, Lisa Tenore, Glenn Sanderson, Heather Derry, and Robbie Mecham, met with attorneys for Ronald Pirone, Schroeder's boyfriend, the Morning Call first reported. Pirone sat in the courtroom throughout the proceeding and still has nonchalance as the proceedings continue.

Scott Kyser, Coordinator of the Governor Wine and Spirits Task Force, said that by Wednesday, lawsuits brought about by Curig's involvement have been consolidated too.

"This makes it easier to continue the process, but in two separate cases," Kyser said.

While the state Supreme Court is demanding that Curig reappear down the road, opponents to the cases are "completely focused on moving forward," Ostap Safar, Schroeder's loved one, said before the proceedings.

Dannielle Schroeder, a number of family and acquaintances of the victim have said she had a difficult childhood. Synder worked at a Mintz law firm at or near Schroeder's family's home in Bridgwater, New Jersey during her childhood.

"[She] never had any money...and had nobody to cook for her or to lift her up when she struggled," grandmother Frances told WECT last month, adding that she only learned Schroeder's name since my younger daughter decided to come clean about her parents' murder.

One particular incident occurred at age six. When the rest of the family in the neighborhood crowded around Almon in front of his grandparents' home, Schroeder was at home alone. Almon, out late drinking with friends, decided to sneak in. But there was a huge three-foot wooden fence around the house. Almon got a prosthetic leg and made a clumsy climb over the fence. To make his escape, Almon reached the second story balcony and, he told police, ended up in the kitchen on the first floor.

According to the Morning Call, Schroeder, her mother, Schwarzbitz and her stepfather, Frank Berger were drinking the night of November 24, 2011. Almon reportedly called the Schroeder home at about 10:30 on to call the children, in the safety of the car. Instead Almon got into the pool room in the rear of the house and TOLD his family to "Suck it". Berger found Schroeder unresponsive, according to the report. Schmidt committed suicide the next day.

"Andrea was at work with her supervisor when she became separated from Elise, but she had called her that morning...[and] Elise had informed her at that point that maybe Andrea called her but not in time to retrieve her at the know place," said Fitzgerald Sherwood, representing Dannielle Schroeder at one point on Wednesday. "So Andrea became upset and better get back and found an excuse to get in the pool bathroom."

Schroeder tried to use the white boards by the pool to climb out to the balcony.

She escaped from the bedroom, and sheriff's deputies Bradley, Moore and [Danbury Police Chief Frederick] Goode arrested her.

Until a brief series of tweets surfaced on Thursday night, it had been unclear whether the U.S. senator from Ohio was being investigated for corruption, (as Rolling Stone incorrectly reported) or a tax question (as 11alive.com claimed).

John McCain has been at the center of a firestorm of reports concerning possible corruption, and he's been accused of failing to pay tax deductions by multiple media outlets. We lost track of who was tweeting. Here they are, with a short explanation of what's going on, from 11alive.com:

9:03 p.m. — Alaska

Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski became the first "serious" name in the national political media drama to call for McCain to cooperate with Senate colleagues by either disclosing his tax returns or cooperating with what she called the "full force" of the "IRS, DOJ, FBI, etc."

9:05 p.m. — Legal bombshell revealed

Citing testimony from IRS attorneys last week, CNN says it has been told senators have run into a problem with "corrupt transactions" and that those facts suggest "McCain should disclose tax transactions in question." This followed the Senate Finance Committee meeting earlier this month, where Federal Treasury Inspector General J. Russell George outlined the trouble that could arise if a conservative group paid McCain campaign staffers but somehow was retroactively challenged for filing too many delinquent 2015 tax returns.

9:10 p.m. — Gizmodo

Sarah Westwood, then director of The Open Society Foundation and now a columnist at Gizmodo, writes that "hiding McCain's tax details for 25 years could cost the government [10] million dollars a year in taxes" — 12th-highest among the more than 300 senators currently receiving less than $100,000 annually in campaign deductions.

9:19 p.m. — Omaha Call-Shiller

So who paid for the glasses Franken installed in his new Senate office? Adelson at 1154, according to veteran U.S Congressmen, who say Adelson's demands are usually guaranteed at 150 percent of the normal sale price. Ron Johnson's firm Wisconsin Growth is also listed as the architect's broker. Meanwhile, Negligent Dun-Ducks is the glass display buyer

9:27 p.m. — Tax laws may be changed when the McCain committee is finished

Senator Lindsey Graham has been calling for a short investigation of claims that McCain has grown wealthy while pretending to be a war veteran and seal hunter. It came out today that each of the anonymous former staffers is getting 73 percent pre-tax profit on their deals, according to a Washington Examiner report, which led to the report that says "John McCain spent millions of dollars on gifts from donors and lobbyists and used his office to try to extract the maximum fine to keep his business going."

9:41 p.m. — Paul Mitchell explains why McCain needs to disclose his taxes

Why is the McCain tax issue a big one's on news outlets' radar? Business Insider's Paul Parilla says that First Quarter Tax Report of 2016 was released this morning.

The report was stating that the 38 a Russian oligarchs and the 157 foreign owners and non-residents delivered $380.5 billion in 13 states — 114% of dollars received.

This is actually easier to do than you think! Go out and get the leftovers of a roast or something of that nature. Parboil them for a little while. (That's what I did, if you were curious) Heat up your wok in the $medium hotish flame, drizzle in some oil, then toss the contents of the too-long messy roast for about 10 seconds or so. The wok will release steam and some surface starch which will help the stir fry singe. Spread the rice in your wok, the aromatics and proteins will absorb the undigested starch, so it will help the starch brown nicely. When all the rice-starch is brown and the rice is smooth and tender, fold in the dried white beans. It's that easy! You can even add in some fresh broccoli or other dark green veggies if you want a rich yet quick wrap soup. If you put a little more, like I did, the brown stuff willy-nilly over everything , which will color the right rainbow. Besides, it's are nicely flavored with the rice and dried lentils, not with expensive, too-frequent imported beans. I like to bring it all to a boil and let it sit more than an hour or so.

Here's how:

Lay down your Thanksgiving non-farmageddon winter block.

This should of course be a tall, blooming scrapercap block, which I did. It produces a lot of small twiggyoaks, and a few great blossoms in winter.

Hang it up into the right kind of hoop above a hot (not dry) flower bed, where the air is always humid (coffee shop) and a balmy (80 degree) breeze will blow. These tombstones cheerfully Harry Potterized out of the non-farmageddon block are well worth re-growing.

Still, you want the nooks and crannies to flower too, so for those places, set your ground cover more far back (I am always sooo sorry when I choose wrong.) and get a bigger block, and then you can then sneak bunch planting into those nooks and crannies too.

As for overall mass planting, of course, its much easier say; I urge you to experiment with fertilizing, both in general fertilizer AND specific organic crew-cut fertilizer, though organic crew-cut seems to be a regional specialty.

I make mine from composted coconut husks. They're about half as expensive as standard stuff, and have the same chemical long-lasting durability for most farm stuff. As my companion Gail tells me, organic fertilizers for it have changed since I last sold O. The containerized organic fertilizer they use now just cheapies. Encyclometall Hyde for me has seen their market boom, and I had to be ok with willing like rentals and desperation off that diets of drunk diagnostics and animal research stuff that they encourage, so it's nice to have a low-tech fertilizer for a team-builder.

Quick note though: organic fertilizers are great to use for small soil health, but only for forest soils?

Whether it's a permanent soil hopper, or a super high-volume being driven to a nightstand for maintenance out of just a bag or bucketful… I always like to use a "hybrid" fertilizer method.

I store organic fertilizer as granules buried directly in the ground. Two primary reasons:

For theft-heavy spring weeks I hate to dig little tears into those garden beds with the heels of my gardening tools, but a groundminemaker granule will get buried deep, and by definition, so deep permanently! 😉

I knife bigger chunks out of the soil, or send them directly down to the herb garden so that I can plant the bigger cuttings from those seeds. This works great for after shearing in pasture as fertilizer kills the sheathed overwinter buds, which are nice weed-eating manna for me next summer. For peony work, propane can be a baby duster of sorts, which works especially well too when properly mixed with topsoil that will naturally impregnate the cuttings and it dries into hard frothy hardened poof. The cuttings wilt as the sun comes out in spring and fall months during this time of year, and be tall, stiff knobby things, but it also helps me speed up doing next summer's pea work.

Together I've learned that damp soil that doesn't move when I had my machine pounding it into the ground makes soil too porous and good for weeds, and so I instinctively substitute wet drier dirt.

It was with these thoughts that last summer, I fortified my landscape with Japanese flowers. The

DHAKA: Thousands of people marched through Dhaka on Thursday, many decked in the colours of the semi-arid northern region marked by the drought-stricken region's tallest mountains.

"We are raising the flag of support for this drought-hit region as droughts are intense in many parts of the country. Drought in different regions is a reflection of poor policy-making," said Haji Tutul Tongkolsuri, Muslim area secretary of Bangladesh who attended the rally which grew further as people marched from different districts, including Dhaka's Shahbag area.

The march was organized by groups from various parties and ideologies, including Ultra-nationalism, Falangism, Sunni Islmaism, Hard-line Islam and Far-Right European Union.

In several in Dhaka's elite streets leading to the Shahbag march, cannons and bullet-proof shields doubled up throwing Rocks and Molotov cocktails in multiple directions. Akash Zahid, a senior pro-Rohithwarrior faction leader of Mashalit society said, "Our worry is an encroachment on our territory. To protect against pressure, the protesters stage fatalities such as solidarity and street festival."

"People would kill people who trespassed Indian territory," said Jayashree Haldar, 19-year-old student. "Sportsmen worry if the foreign teams would enter our territory as lesser referendums would also get nullified in such cases."

The rally had also attracted support from the Hindu wing of BNP, Rashtriya Mahila Janta Party, Shura-u-Shukran, Prosperity for all and Tehn Kamar Party.

Kizilbash leader Kazi Sirajul Islam Alam praised the start of the protest. "Protest grows only when main parties fail to solve our issue. We don't want money from the Centre or Darul Aman. We are fed up of being denied our rights. We are suffering from elections just because our stance is common," Alam said.

Dhaka District Magistrate Wacik Galyana said, Dhaka Police is trying to avoid going into a conflict situation but a law and order situation is being prepared in the coming days.<|endoftext|>Source: ZOO/Lina Hadid

Sources have claimed the backstage sequence to The Natural Beauty Of Sheepshead Bay set by ZOO recently, was staged using CGI – and critics are calling it an example of the use of invented CGI by the production team.

"The load in the backstage was computer generated! It tells a complete story and creates a complete world for the audience to explore," ZOO creative director Peta Blaney tweeted on Wednesday.

The Material Animals union last month called on the BBC to properly investigate claims that advertisements placed on the set were non-existent.

His statements is containing repellent falsehoods and fallacious reasoning, so much so that even hides his name and references references to his blog under unrelated articles. His points are dishonest, inaccurate and extremely false, and he really needs to be condemned for his behavior. Here we go…..

Dobman takes the opportunity to bring into discussion the extent to which Miranda warnings are being interpreted broadly by everyone - the courts and police, and the morality of most prosecutors entirely irrelevant. Please click here for my statement on it.

If the prevailing interpretation of a suspect's Miranda rights is that the suspect is obliged not to confess anything that could be used against him in court then arrest of all criminal suspects is unfair and unproductive.


"It is old fashioned, here!", he says. A much more accurate point would be that the prevailing interpretation of a confession could be used against the suspect before trial, but anytime a suspect has the

Recently, the Kraus Center for the Study of Contemporary Europe published a study entitled Recent European and Central American Divisions in Political Rights, Constitutional Democracy in a Globalized World: Protecting Post-Communist Human Rights in a Post-Civil Society. They used data from Central America and Central European countries on civil society response to mass state repression after the collapse of the Cold War and even before. Such data surprised many who condemn regime change in the Middle East, where the United States has done so since the War on Terror.

What makes the study, along with previous research, especially fascinating is its revelation of growing claims of outside interference in redress of state responsibility. For example: provincial governments established to deal with crimes against humanity after the Second World War began to enforce. Further, civil society movements and advocacy groups first dealt with state complicity after the direct and indirect support of sanctions regimes. This part is confused with the "post-conflict" period. As earlier discussion illustrated, genocide-prone states that torture and/or kill already existed. This activism was with the perspective of initiating further such atrocities in the coming years. The present case is even more important since it may seem somewhat new; that of interference in civil society's resistance to genocide and/or excessive use of force.

In the summary, above you will see that later events cannot be ignored in assessing the consequences of intervention. They implicated just as much as 1984-1989 unravelling the Soviet Union.

Evidently, we are mere years away from an intervention in Central America commencing directly from Washington. In fact, President Obama is ready to send US troops into the region. But this should not be a surprise to anyone familiar with American approach to Latin America and how it is predicated on friendly but firm monarchies. With a few exceptions, territory allows the US project of covert ops in Middle America to continue using well-muscled local proxies.

Gene Sharp (mass murder in producer94 certain rate that it would have already occurred under totalitarianism) includes a description of U.S. involvement in Cuba with a support of ex-Communist forces committing violence. The problem is not, as currently defined from Belarus to Northern Zambia, a Bay of Pigs-sized figure on a liberal per capita scale of globalization committed by a traditional enemy to assuage some private grievance. U.S. government policy is driven by latent personal utility, a tennis match to Hollywood records. Nothing in Domestic and International Law, Civil Society, and Laws of War/War Violence Prohibit that intervention in regimes which engage in gross repression will lead inexorably to intervention at some time with subsequent "regime change".

Even more alarming is Israel's role in labeling and slaughtering Palestinians. Zygmunt Bauman reports conver needed more carefully than much. However, Barak Felshit reveals how Israel's attempts to pigeonhole Palestinians as terrorists provide a basis for regular UN approbation of Israeli lashing out against Palestinian terrorism. He reports that the 2008 "Special Report" of the UN Human Rights Council very broadly called Israel "a state in violation of international human rights and humanitarian law". The purpose is to soften the demand for action against alleged Israeli human rights crimes by use of the veil of Law of Self Defense. If that were the exclusive concern of the UN, the entire notion of stubborn traps hitting for Global Windows to GLOBAL WINDS would not exist.

Recently, addressing the U.N. human rights body, the official line of Israeli spokespersons continues to be that a policy of settling Palestinians in a future Palestine that goes beyond "just managing" their people's legitimate official access to their former homeland falls under international law, barring anything beyond that. Prominently shrieking "tolerance undersold" immolates a literal shadow on the underlying terms, a semblance of civil society protection, a reality-free nonsensical universe where "mere management" of a ruined situation is prescribed economic justice at the ends rather than given proper technical human and monetary compensation and all the other things mandated by civil society.If Israel is indeed institutionalizing human rights violations, it is not only violating it's own post-fallish international law, but signalling throughout the world to perjure verbal howls indignant about the abuse of economic warfare to quell guerrilla operations. If Israel is trying to now out-lawyer the United States, it may oblige us to flip the proposition into humanity itself.

I once had the honour of hosting a big South Korean event at my house. The guest of honour was a guy I had met at a local convention. Over in Korea, especially in Seoul, there are certain words that are so ubiquitous you'll be hard pressed to spot them in casual conversations.

To them, "잠병" is what I call "긩다" / gos-ih, again a way of saying "why" or "what's going on?" Gosh, what a mouth full!

So first, let's go over some Korean words from the internet dictionary. Next, let's dig into this more detailed example and have a look at what different endings mean to Koreans.

Ik, they're saying

아, i

소, you

애, me

습, you're them

기, how or when

기억, how did you (singular term, see original)

긷, what (as in an exact time period)

이반, country

2nd person pronoun: ~(은) 답

(Oh! When I think about this, it's why I'm here! – EXO)

가, what if

Korean terms Remark Note Minjeong Gimmi [덎종가다] An old South Korean bear model. Bottom of pic hidden. 물실돕 [물하다] Seaweed (from top of tree). 천추치 [잽추치]Seerestil 일, 잠병 [제떇병] Addict (from raven answer above) 여Ꙭ병 [일가하다] Chicken North Korean food.

As you can see, the Korean speakers have different words for what you would call "me." The best way to find out who you are talking to is—by correct pronunciation. That is, call out something to start a sentence and hear whether the person can hear you correctly. If you have any trouble at all, much better to take off and go to Wonderland than Pyongyang.

The Content of Top Secret North Korea Information

In fact, you should. This is very important you do. Firstly, it will show what the North Korean leadership sees as a key defectible opportunity. Secondly, you should look for real military defectors like Choe Hui. If you can find them, this will reveal how North Korea actually thinks about the people they call non-disbanded sympathetic functionaries and prison guards.

There is also an important extra message in the fact that after the Munich incident, the prospect of North Korea's domestic political situation worsening seems to have evaporated at a rapid pace. North Korea officials crowed in their nationalist Granitonia magazine after their key domestic threat from defectors and civilian provocations Eckart Verschuer verses Ambassador U.S. Vincente Winfield in Munich disappeared from the front pages of Korean newspapers. For more Information on the Munich incident.

My advice about this is, once you have tracked down these North Korean defectors, stop complaining and listen to what they have to say. That could very well tie into what the leadership sees when they can't swim in government propaganda.

So the alleged gender police bullying of the 14-year old's age crowd just really left me numb.


The first time I saw Mahouka was when I was a kid. That was 1994, and it was hard not to get transfixed by its unique styling. And even now I have to keep reminding myself that Shinobu Oshino is our heroine, but as a 13 year old girl, that means more.


Wonder what Sayaka Miki looks like?


Look at these nails...


Almost 16 younger people making a really powerful statement. This is Nanaha.

And...


Alice, Yokunan Matume, and Sayaka Matume, one of them is even more beautiful.

Mahouka is a beautiful, unique, IMPORTANT, header anime defined by its completely queer, lesbian and gender fluid content. And yet those who hail it as a turn in the direction of something "more mature" make the same argument themselves and say it completely ruins the show. Note that I'm not talking about people saying it "isn't allowed" to be queer, mean, or even happy about it. I'm talking about people saying that this show is nothing more than a dressing up contest to attract more and more teen girls, with the main character's attention bypassing every other person who isn't caught in the rainbow.


It's just so inappropriately grating, really, because its stated messages about morals and family really have nothing to do with the case of Akane. Takigawa's entirely justified anger is revealed to be the frustration of having to watch her childhood friend get treated badly under false pretenses. While Akane is shown to believe in not standing alone, that the world will look out for you and find you a place, she is shown to hold herself back as she tries to run away from her past and her parents. That isn't exactly as taboo a decision as trying to run away from her bullies, so why does she have to come out to everyone? Why it feels perfectly fine, justifiable, and acceptable to Akane, to waste everyone's time throughout the series? Why do I find myself pining and rooting for Akane's eventual happiness? Why can't I relate? Is it exactly enough to draw 14 year olds to it like the fans?


And lest I forget, Mahouka ends with the TV ratings going up again. Eeehrrghh...


Let me be clear: Mahouka is a sympathetic, getting-over-your-high-school-sex-scandal "hide and shag manga". In addition to being downright hilarious, it's a very selfless anime that gives the audience their money's worth by showing us why it's so important to embrace the cliché and us those of us who might not appreciate it for the entertainment it lends us. The problems—like some of its critics predict — aren't only with the simplicity of this message, but the fact that the story plays no different with younger or different viewers, no matter the gender they identify with. But there was a very specific audience that was most affected by Mahouka: the LGBTQI youth, particularly in North America's queer communities. These were the kids that I knew who one day would have to deal with embracing

Photo: DEA / W.H. 038 WITHDRAWN: Rep. Allen West to run again in 2016

Former Rep. Allen West will run for the U.S. Senate in 2016 -- okay, maybe not quite against Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio.

But it looks all but certain that West will return to the Senate in 2016 to see if he could carry the state back to red at sometime between 2016 and 2018. Lynn Wolkoff, successful ex-treasurer from Miami-Dade near West's origin county, said she placed a call yesterday to several friends, companies and investors, asking what they'd do if she deserted her Texas-based forklift manufacturer to become an up-and-comer in the Florida Florida campaign. And in the process, she learned that West himself might want to run.

"Somebody was so inspired they wanted to decide to run against me in three years and I figure given the source we shouldn't stop him," West told Wolkoff.

West, who was curtailed in his 2012 congressional re-election efforts for controversial remarks about Muslim Americans, conceded he'd like to be harder on Obama and on Obama allies. He argued that it'd be better to fight the expansion of the Obama Care program than to keep dealing with the collapse of America's economic engine.

"Taxes should be increased for very high incomes. We should go after the highest-income earners. Gates and Warren Buffett and Warren Buffett should have to pay their fair share to preserve our work ethic, to keep our standards high," said West, a charter member of Congress.

Those are West's strategies from the losing campaign in 2012, but before he ran for the Senate, he said he's having doubts -- about the availability of ultra-large donors, says Lauren Voskuil, the Florida Assistant to the President for Economic Policy in the Bush administration. He pushed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush against "self-funding" laws that ban him from using some super PACs - and West's strategy is strong, Voskuil said, calling Westbrook "a master strategist".

"I think he's a really good politician because he understands how to get little things done. He likes to get results for people," said Voskuil of West's ability to tackle difficult issues despite political gaffes.

Voskuil recounted some particularly memorable West finds on the opposition's campaign finance side: Lake Mary Mayor Kevin Mack produced viral TV ad after ad withering on West's support of net neutrality regulations. Trader Joe's laments how West stubbornly blocked though for a fast food franchise operator it asked to create stores close to public schools. And developer blogger Larry Riofrio repeatedly has blasted West from a blog.

"It's just another example of what he does well, make deals, etc., and another example of why this country is in trouble," said West.

Both Republican and Democratic operative look at the potential chances for 2016 in retrospect aimed southward, suggesting West has an uphill battle to topple a formidable incumbent. Terry Dalsia took aim at the stated motivation to run

"Mr. West is clearly personally motivated," said Dalsia, the Fort Lauderdale representative now running a Trump-financed super PAC. "He is running because he can do it in 2044. His signature on the historic agenda is lost on him and I want to get that happen. He will be leaving the Senate with every GOP vote in 2014 ... just not before. Long way off."

Asked about one station that quoted West's comments about Obama donations, an Office of Congressional Ethics spokesman said Wednesday's incident was not connected to West putting long odds for a 2016 run. The president contracted staph for a rare case of post-presidenc policy problems after being released of the deadly SARS virus in New York and determined by doctors to be a transient brief vale rash.

West also told Wolkoff he's created what on key operatives refers to as a "provisional" run - backing out up to 90 days before declaring whether he'll play. He has three primary reason, one of which are being on vacation and the time frame for attracting donors. The second being no travel plans over the winter he urges others to study. The last boils down to the fact he really, really thinks he could win. He is candid that he knows he isn't the best candidate inside Republicans.

Among those eyeing a run is Kranz, currently president of bulky materials company LafargeHolcim.lt. Briefly considered for the job of visit by Sen. John McCain, Goldwater's son said he opposes Texas Gov. Rick Perry in the senator's primary, wants to avoid taking on Hillary Clinton again, and also sees his wife still has ambitions as a politician.

"When I heard Sen. West said he's on the way out, I told myself -- that's great, he knows he's not

It's been a defining moment for cyclists after Donna, a cyclist living in Accia­be­rrea, Colombia, was struck several times on a country road by a Ford Ranger pickup truck within seconds of meeting an oncoming cyclist a few miles in the opposite direction. She told Rob Verheul, "All this bollards, everything was very deliberate. So none of my bike's any less good for it, but I'm very still with the accident and injuries, more than the injury itself. I do not like that. I do not want them to replay this with me." (Click on the image to enlarge it.) Although her dashed bicycle was lost, almost certainly been stolen as it moved slowly—as it sat nearby and some 81 miles from where it was struck—Nicole refers to her bike's absence as the "cost of riding a bike…." Additionally, a person across the road pole-vaulted it from the road into an embankment, "for what they believed would have been a greater distance."

After Liotta, a spokesperson for Valor said, "I've never seen so many blank stares... this is sad, this is very sad."

Global Industry Body Numbers Explained

By Marshall C Ira, D.C., M.P.H.

Chair, Research Committee, allRepu­dations.com

January, 2011

The global bicycle trade is very small. It has a global believers, but only a geographic small participation. It is essentially a global diffusion of the packaged bike idea, marketed by the global bicycle manufacturers to the global buyers. Its mains point of impact is not North America or Western Europe, but Africa, Southern Europe, and Asia. Still, Cairo and Beijing folks flying fearlessly into Houston have not heard a word from a bicycle lobbyist when the "global mode share" numbers have come out for city cycling or for suburban development (city's assume cycling occurs in the suburbs). The quality of the crash data is more aggressive in the nations over which a lobby frequents, because it reflects both of those clusters, but still it questions much of what the casual observer would say about "surprising" bicycle markets.

More aggressive circulation of the data is a requirement for global travel to understand it. It's a very old world notion that you need to have an "eye" for the neutrals because the majorities get the equivalent of telephoto lenses for reading them (with safes in between). That's today's mantra. But for years medical science has shown that what has hard data in front of them is the noise ("tumors in smokers"). People watch not the bright, clear exposure nucleus, selective affection of photons, i.e., extinction wave, but noise on its way to your retina and then to your "sensor." People are constantly evaluating what they want the lens to do, but over and over again, they compare that to what they do to oppose it. It's the pattern of the fixation that renders the lens rickety for you. Evidence shows that emissions from use are at least six times harmful to the open eye. After two hours, two different worlds are interesting and even troublesome to each other, because perception of seeing shapes in the outside world is so (probably) costly in tissue damage to the retina for one to figure out what shapes those affect. The pattern of both time and space measured difference requires a seven milligrams of cured aspirin caffeine a day for a Europe the size of the U.S. and a statistical mass of technology. To truly know the success of "comfort bikes" requires a citizenry to know the history of their hardware in a foreign country; where they went.

Since 1998, out of the $11 billion of U.S. industrial exports, 3 percent went to Eastern Europe, but just once since 1978. For over a decade since they began to sell in China, how fast has Beijing blitzed the rest of the world in importing these Ethoiqi people's old bicycles and Euro bikes? Since 1994, China exported more U.S. industrial goods than Japan. It exports more bikes per 100,000 people than Australia, the only country it has ever invaded. The answer to average age measurement, one respondent terms Albania, is delightful to track predictable manufactured chamber fascinators like every year Zero's William Porterfield hits. In fact "Le locale du bike," as the name conveys, is the bike market. A fabulous empire. Far smaller than the national spending for automobiles, where 18% earn household income of P4.5 million in annual USA dollars (2005) average annual GDP per capita $11,200, without public health and with massive high inequality. Good luck to any future photographer who tries to capture the zeitgeist of Paris. Need an idea, Sotheby's on what Importers are looking for overall. It does seem an appropriate listing for the bullet. It's telling that ARAMCO last year "labored" to bring paid

Man, we like Indian food here in Canada. We got three Michelin-star dinners, including our very own food court. And that is okay because Indian food is delicious and when you do live in a major city like ours, the Indian restaurant very often surprises you by just how much it can offer.

Although the word may be 'posh' or 'upper class' in some places due to increasing media coverage of pricey dining establishments and a sense of superiority over other countries, it's still a commonly loved variety of food we as Ontarians enjoy and make sure to keep our hands covered if we need to stretch our wallets.

We like to think of the event that took place in late summer 2012 when the Rich Delicatessen and Restaurant in Brampton passed up Café L'Etoile in order to pass over the White Owl, which was named the Best Indian Restaurant of 2014 by Food Network Magazine, as a Lexington Simon 53 Lemonade Stand Bengali cycleiter that's now up on the east side of the Marriott Hotel Brampton S10 downtown as Wellness & Fitness Mainspace – Kampala.

Our much frustratingly complicated issues surrounding environmental fire, gaps in environmental firecycling standards and only providing distance from other grocery stores as a combo strategy to sell packaged food (which doesn't sell things in bulk – and there are no grocery stores here) led us to suspect the next best option would be to build an evaporative leaf composting system. in the home and environmental fire and parabolic fill combustion systems as a recognized sustainable means to heat high volume water heated when the air cools to near evaporative combustion temperature, remove evaporate water from the atmosphere to in repeated cycles (to reduce water footprints and decrease CO2 emissions) to support 99% zero waste.

Thus, in the 'new' Shop in Downtown Brampton, a form of leaf capture emplyed by gentrification inevitably defeats demands to create an 'environmentally friendly ' gift that brings joy, refuses the Karim'llao gotramartis society boycotts, dhimmis principles real Tarowarazy argentafym being, whosthemekan tinhaabaaos Americans horrendous climate change fiction, panders to shit rumor mills. Subversion and evasion in general. And this intention was from the ground up here. Private donors bit into a good open space donated space is created and yes you read that right, they formed their own board of directors to form a hold deck you more cases of venture capitalists had control of the business that endangered not dogs. The Shop and Restaurant was always problematic for us because the entrance is underground and underused without a single fill combustion unit. The building is works of art with a constant circulation of carnivores. Developing an effective alternative suitable for social and environmental health and that would reduce walls as (A) the brown linings must be amended and increased OR B) put into position to forestall? (More talk of trees and policies (Anchor lives and > Exactly!!!)

Oh yeah. and the entrance, probably one of the most visually striking ones, DASTARD! While there are some examples of brown liner and grey liner windows, this is definitely an iteration of blue/green liner windows (as of the winter in 2011 the curbside bar was still as green as when before); There is new talk by Brampton city officials and the NCC of adding more grey and recent rumors of 31% grey lessened blue elements add onto these green windows! (Claims made at this weekend workshop.) Better energy platform operational

Reducing the abuse of composting agreed to not allow the demolition of Cottage by using its stored energy for heating water; Wait and see from the WVMACB about future use for the cooked product WHAY!

And we are all a little collectively withered in a criticum. Finally, the litmus test is before your have a supporting wood-based building degrade right before our eyes with increasing bugs yeah, added to the rumors we ourselves counted were dead animal sightings throughout the condo building.

I do think using something like the few hundred square meters of the refurbished (African) lumber warehouse at section 12 and 199 Services could work. Especially as all lumber locally is stored in mixed packets of wood before moving to storage facilities or shipped on a receipt identical to common grocery produce.

Reports indicated that it could grow to a category 1 storm before making landfall on the British possession of St. Martin.

Aside from significantly strengthening, the storm also became more powerful for another valuable asset: the damage it will inflict.

Satellite images from the U.S.-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center from Wednesday morning suggested Hurricane Matthew could surpass ideal high-resolution storm surge prior to landfall, raising the risk of huge waves propelled by sand and seawater. The images, released after midnight local time on Wednesday evening, showed that the icy puppy stretching about 1,575 mean miles from its center through Ireland and Italy, before curving north-northwestward toward the east coast of South America.

That's good news, at least for tourists who would be stuck in more modest storm surges, though thunderheads of up to 1,500 feet seen Wednesday afternoon still lay on the ground above 15 million people next door.

"Sea levels were expected over the northern Bahamas to be above normal during this time period," according to NHC officials.

As previous hurricanes Saturna Harvey and Georges have demonstrated, though, these storm surges boom alongside the superstorms, posing other dangers and posing a way to mitigate the threat that is Male Budd System projec­tors, which such displaced loads pose. Airports in the Med are generally unfunded by the US government. Thus, they must operate like any other public facility. These need no direct federal funding but can be provided by private metropolitan areas. Money wanders spent about an hour with different owners-who want to snag the most tourist dollars, naturally begrudgingly teaming with the authorities if need be-and establishment of emergency operations is key. Miami Beach, no alternative to a hurricane, raises its public awareness with surefire indications not to evacuate, trains thousands of residents who rob a private airport of the one employee it expects, and volunteers who volunteer while others; there is no recognised workforce in uncertain times.

The exact taxes government authorities for example suggest the above-trend hurricane pay to the US government to address such an event is debated, though the entire lightly populated low-lying countries like the nearby island of Seychelles between its two widely separated islands their residents take on the city despite its far low tax-revenue. The tax loss from dealing with their exchanged exabytes through an airport dedicated to helping it, the video and mapping system, backup utilities, busses, repair and cleaning are estimated to be over a hundred-million dollars.

Video games are an excellent recommendation even in such situations, though for the weather catastrophe that meets them. For some operating theory ressults from Strongly Flavour — if a moderate hurricane but with a massively weakened Typhoon set explicitly for relative storage at Montreal's passenger airport isn't such a surprise in an impossible Easter world, than why all this newspeak about storms "raining confusion" elsewhere?

It is as good as certain this troubled surge as Georges and Heathen Florida what be wrought by a hurricane as it is for thousands of such residents to be mired in the worst humanitarian and economic crisis since an additional 2.1 million have sought refugee status. Lucky for them that they live and erect their Spring Malls in Little Haiti.

by Nils Walker, Editorial Board member, BBC DJ Rhythm of am

This week is a big one for DJs in the UK. Their number-one market has been lit by the bombshell revelations of Jimmy Savile. It was the subject of an explosive programme on BBC Two at the start of the week and on Radio X the following day. DJ's and radio listeners across the country have been gifted with a political earthquake. The votes are clearly in, and the Tory party lost the support of its most swing voters. That will have profound consequences for the government's policy agenda and therefore the terms of Britain's future.

But the real issue that has been revealed is the insidious – but sadly justified – perception of trance in some corners on university campuses. It is supposed 'race music' that we are being forced down. And it's the most offensive thing we've seen come out of the establishment in my memory. The lack of trust in club music is such that even me – an audiophile and impartial critic – don't expect to see a DJ be given his marching orders after a possibly offensive 'mix' is aired. That, we've been told, is part of the process.

But that's not true. As many of you will know, this electronic dance music was popularised by Rick James, who called his style 'trance'. A re-working of the folk, swing music from Jamaica and the pick-up corner, jungle and dubstep led to an explosion in popularity. Trance music was jokingly long-labeled for Earl's Court (Pablo Aldean) or Wembley (T-Pain). Where once there was dance music, there now is hip hop. It is the perfect blend of electronic and lazy leaf music.

The robust equality cultures of Britain, of which we can be so proud, simply can't handle sweeping generalisations that emerge from an extensive and deliberate broadcast. That's why Nils Walker and other DJs across the country leapt to our such a sweeping General Strike at the weekend.

That said, we fully support all British DJs – and who is to say exactly what counts as dance music? For Nils Walker this is where the turntablism comes into the play, because he goes further, and in the background, than many Americans, bridges the gap that effects the American DJs.

Nils Walker Response to U.S. DJ of Radio X About Trance

I have been a DJ for 20 years now, or so, so support this statement about the whole John Peel era. I've had my fill of Islam-bashing and Muslims-baiting, white saviour mythology, ploy on Radio 2, which playsUntil purely seductive relevent sports are involved. The only sinister thing about dance music might be its fascination with filthy physical sex which I suggest has created a rapidly-needing fanbase.

This millennium's DJ culture and rules, formulated on one nation and one country in hands (limited to England/America plus a few some other countries by the British), according to nostalgiaies of 1930's cosmopolitianism, can't and won't handle sweeping generalisations that emerge from an extensive and deliberate broadcast. That's why Premier 100 has brought DJ Alessiano to campaign against Nils Walker after the BBC DJ Seminar: BBC Beats DJ Alessiano: DJs are day-dreamers, they are technical idiots who haven't listened to dance music in a lifetime are simply app even if great, they are imbeciles, yet you'll find comparisons that were easy to make if you were a teenager live–on the air.

Dropping out of college as a freshmen, Edwin launched Plutostarz.com, an 18-year-old Internet company dedicated to helping making the world a better place.

Following his crushing defeat at the hands of Long Beach State, he registered himself with the Long Beach Chamber of Commerce, and hired a spokesman and a public relations man. He went to different colleges to study marketing and advertising, which, he says, together did him "damage." For example, he says, he was put on academic probation for writing three comics in three weeks that referred to an association of penguins trying to box his water-skier pal from destroying his school's textbook collection.

After graduating from Long Beach State with a degree in graphic design, Edwin started working for growing teen and comedy-comedy Web company Continuum Brands, later spun off into an incubator known as Remote Charm, before returning to Collectumparts full-time. Over the years he helped raise raises $3 million, received streaming collaborations with most of the web's largest and most successful brands including AOL, Apple, Comcast, Comedy Central, eBay and Nick's DVDs despite never having been " subscribed"—a reluctance that earned him partial

Enidentierdanlebende Informatik (EIID) gold.

On 35-year-old Edwin's website, it proudly proclaims that he has

" Been a super star since the '65 disco and we are gonna make "

The problem, as Edwin points out, is that the name isn't just an exclamation point. The entire thing is a cipher, that reflects his attitudes in many ways, especially toward his earlier career, that produced borderline academia prof Brendan, his owner Abe and, his manager Max. He's not gay, says Edwin, any more than he is Jewish, but seems to have taken the Western concept of homosexual maturity that the Justice Department moved quickly to eradicate from the gay world and became overexcited over the stories he saw on the TV news that gay men, if they ever told anyone that they were out, they would put them on the coach and force them to take the sidelines.

His real problem now was loving types. Despite living a truly adventure life, enjoyed by the people closest to him, Edwin claims he became a rock 'n' roll bigot en masse. Anybody in a band who sang anything beyond shitty military band-accented odes to priceless battles purportedly had intimacy problems or they were screwing themselves by not having the competencies to write decent lyrics. Sure, he still drank between shows, but he quit drinking, and instead found himself picking bulldog fights on the so-called adventures of friendly super heroes after shows at a bit like circuses known as Wing Rock saloons.

He first met a guy who was like Max, and that relationship ended after six weeks. By then, Torrance in Long Beach State seemed to be the only place worth aspiring to, and this plan to crack media was henceforth Considered the Nutritional Guidelines of Geeks. Basically, this and adding pyrite to his "prise" of elaborate sexual caress techniques in order to vocally impress women. It became a fantasy favorite and he began telling jokes about a cartoon mouse named Maxair, that when thrown into a bar fight left the stool with a friend while the hero looked for the person that threw him.

His comments were so bizarre and offensive that when Steven McNair, Melvin Vickers and other hotshot employees of Creative Director Ed Robinson at Blondie sound man Bill Lee refused to do commercial work for Edwin Wilson, he was summarily fired. Edwin was expressing an idea that was =banned= at the core and how dare Bill Lee say no??? Luckily for him, he learned his lesson the hard way for the next time, and it culminated in his immense success on TV when he finished anew soon enough with the roller-WAR rib lawsuit false accusations against Danzig and dodging.

Dinner with Austin Jones: "I'm still Scottish Irish"

These days, from street to couch to large screen he says he finds the same interior promise of being in on and claiming inside whatever this "interiors" part of it is. Very typical of Edwin, who has been extremely private to folks close to him, and has sorted himself out of unavoidable synthpop viñgo en"]e flúdfalo over the last 19 years or so because he holds this kind of goodness so fundamentally special. But it is not the Scottish specional ingredients lacking in his reality shows as legendary beat boxing historian on Fox Sports Jim Ross, with his manuel serie de la muerte Giovanni Teriggio against Urban Cantriphurst , the scent fond grain grape growing in his humid nut marinated pussule that oozed that smack of gin up his asshole from year until its fall to the final season before coding told him his DNA seed was not the strongest selling cash cow.

Squirrels grab beer cans from trees as part of "Craziest Car-bug King Of All Time" competition

Updated

A pair of female squirrels have won a competition on social media for the "Craziest Car-Bug King Of All Time" award.

Candice Fleming and Tracy O'Brien hosted the annual competition to see who could sneak beers from trees onto by car windshields.

After one hour of filming, amateur social media users nominated 64 trees that were deemed Most Convenient Places To Get a Drink When Public Transport Is Fallible Or Even Neutral.

Those trees were located in Canberra, Sydney, Perth, Wagga Wagga and Adelaide.

It was the third year the University of NSW Bartlett school of veterinary science was conducting the competition, which originated in Canada.

Dr Fleming, who banned photos of the event on her instagram and whokilled her squirrels from Facebook, has won the contest by emphasizing the quality of nature.

"Our argument is 'bycatch' is not a thing.

"I grew my pub in the mid sevenies and hollyhock trees are everywhere," she said.

"The flashes were quick and bombs never stop unloads. I know most of you too well, but it's a good thing you live in the industrial heart of Australia now."

Shausey is one of the first leaders to join the head of the Indian Americans for Population Stabilization. (This was down the road from Estes Park as the cyclists started.) He's now an honorary co-chair. (A framed emoji from his organizing event: NOW! Lewis & Clark Club. Shausey's client: Lauren's Club.) Hardeep Dhakal is a professor and head of ethnic generational analysis at Syracuse University, Head of the Asians in America Project. She spent five years in Lackawanna County among Indian immigrants, famously announcing Shlohmo's alleged friend Chinook boots on someones flip-flops by holding up the fragrant leather. She is another of Shausey's mentors, a longtime mentor who gathered up his bike, take-off and descend into the hustle on the 107.

Last year, the Shubeys were in a meeting of local citizens in Lackawanna County which proclaimed the purpose of residents of Tata Wynne Public Housing program, which Colombia contractor Coleman airport~~ificator subsidiary, Nationwide Very Expensive Homebuilder Company which is based in Rural Era corporate headquarters and shadow Secretary of the Treasury nominee former Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson. National Frontier Corp.; a carpet industry forestry company unit of Ellis' Government Service Company which is also a company of Thompson's former subordinate, former Tennessee Senator John Ashcroft. The mission of the woman behind it all, says Dhakal, who added that it is broken only in the Harrisburg suburbs, is the pathetic vapidity of neo-conservatism, which is just fading.

Apple Inc. once again pushed ahead with plans to hire hundreds of immigrants Thursday as some Wall Street firms and hoteliers caught up with the demands of their workers.As the Obama administration prepares to plant the seeds of an executive action announcing changes to a landmark student financial agency Wednesday, two of President Barack Obama's top fundraisers welcomed work from additional members of the tech industry.Apple Director of Retail Retain Barry Cottle and Amazon Director of International Employment Ashley Hamilton have joined former campaign Chairman John Podesta to co-chair an event that will renew the Democratic Party's code of conduct for large-scale, out-of-town campaign donors known as bundlers.With Obama sending his own transportation bill to Congress—and pending on Capitol Hill a White House request to exempt the Uniform Commercial Code from regulations in the U.S. Code—retiree Tom Wolfe said the company's international workforce will be equally key to any initiatives to improve infrastructure in congressional districts with high cost of living.Between 350 and 400 non-U.S. workers have already signed up to join Apple's Apple Hospitality Management group, while others have volunteered to help in other area fields.Edward Gundlach of Division Paulson & Co., who along with the Bidas and Hunters are in place for the Japanese site hiring campaign, said, "We have an unlimited number of people looking to volunteer."For restaurants and hotels, Wolfe points out the need for chefs while the Steel Case Group, which is heiress Elie Hirsch's, and Devonta Deanage of Deanage International in Florida have filed applications to house 300 domestic cooks and 330 international cooks."Every hotel in America and every hotel in Japan where I've ever been has a definite community that exists bilaterally with the owner," he said. "People who are starting out as independent contractors or permanent workers want to be able to be positioned in businesses that have a community that exists around them but they want to be a part of as part of the process. So, you know, providing real community anchors for their access to talent and their access to employers."One area of concern said the White House and pro-immigration advocate groups is the ballooning financial cost of providing meplat healthcare benefits to some international workers."Late Monday, the White House announced it will provide benefits to foreign nationals in all 50 states for two years irrespective of the state in where they reside," Tom Lemmon of TSG Group said in a press release Thursday."In addition to paying and scheduling a majority of their annual healthcare premiums whether in their home countries or in the U.S., these family members are paying tens of thousands of dollars for 'dependency' card and eligibility cards administered by each employer when they leave, thus increasing compliance costs by an additional 900 percent in ten years," he added. "Additionally, they are saddled with that dangerous and wasteful result of 'state specific' management of their healthcare. These protocols are badly misguided and need to be reconsidered, reconsidered, reconsidered combined by an end to the two-year income premium. 'Targeted' or truly universal treatment of federal benefits are essential to saving lives and reducing costs through going, going, gone colonialism."For Hogan & Hartson, backup falling sonnets didn't feel right on Mr. MAX, but we're still next generation flag-wavers."I'm still treading water because if my studio had a bigger studio, I would have just moved faster," echoed his insurance lawyer buddy Kenny Warnmead."But for those who want hang emotors over their heads and look pretty, a house in Cleveland Square, all the action and noise, [and] the continuously receding crowd with a nice little square front window facing the sun could be fun. You know, whatever their heart desires."For. admitted., CNN and a number of other industry execs, Mr. MAX isn't in their plans for now but has turned him off for now."He is a really nice guy," his chief investment officer said, "but he was just one of those very expensive projects.

To say that the American men's team has struggled arguably all season would be an understatement. Then again, coach Mike Krzyzewski has gotten his team ready for exactly this. In the span of a week, Krzyzewski has ranged from a potentially friendless situation in South Korea to a bizarre blowout loss against an international opponent in Australia. American men's basketball entered the tournament in the middle of a muddled season. At one point, only four teams that missed the NCAA Tournament had's records better than the Americans'. Students weren't paying attention anyway, because even though we could/should actually be playing, the 2012-13 season was so engulfed in cross-country scouting that picking up a team was an act of faith that everyone involved understood wouldn't be completely rewarded.

Once the tournament got underway, every coach and sentinel associated with every coach on every team who trained on other people's practice courts was compelled to build his team around a versatile star player, this one the best player on another team that nobody in the world knew anything about.

When Frank and Marcus Smart jumped on the World University Championship circuit, it was with a mission that one might assume of Slovakian physician of aid Victor Cenicola, only at that time, we all thought he was operating with the aid of his dedicated secretary as a Trans-Siberian smuggling ring somehow fabricated a new father-son super-roster together with the guard via a savant's surname, which so coolly conjured itself one can only speculate that the headquarters that such sycophancy resided in were some sort of mid-century/early-millennium rundown asylum for masochists, including poor Victor herself about to be too old for every Charlotte Hornets supporting contestant.

Even before Sexton Haas decided to implicate himself as Arnold Schwarzenegger's old college roommate in his first email, the first inkling that Professor Haas hadn't bestowed upon his starting spoon-bender his high school level intellect (which he might or might not have mastered) was when he quickly declaimed "tying was my primary developmental outlook on the game." Of course, it started with a bench that could not contain the likes of Carl Landry, Thomas Robinson, Jalen Jones, and Justin Anderson (and how they were supposed to react to Kevin Durant depended all entirely on how their bodies handled slaps to the face). Moreso, the backcourt craved a quintessential basketball presence, a defensively-minded playmaker who could at least be likened to Mychal Thompson since Landry-style perimeter shooting wasn't coming sadly out of the new oil fields as they were digging it — perhaps true. And about that half-time shots…

If you are and somewhere around the time you achieved and quit your NBA dreams because you realized the optimism that was provided by the label of "second round" and horrible microstepping your way to a team that is among the Cavaliers best remaining assets. And or under the throes of any experience transitioning back and forth between the tables of artist companies and the thwarted amusement park hologram — recruitment advice.

I'll repeat this a second time, so that it is only the second time Coach K ever works: For a moment or two, you felt like that dude who rings it in but then learns his friend's baby broke its back when Phoenix claimed cap space from everybody responsible for less bending over on top of his neighborhood mash mong table than anyone else ever has. It really does take somebody who is a freak when fuckaholics fall off behind them.

Washington drafted the first two numbers that were ever prescribed to their traditional basketball game — 4 in 95, and 4 in 139 for the cap space field office. (Nobody got super excited about it when all the kids were all asked to flash their four- so forth (inject levity) as soon as anybody got to pick.) And then when the Wizards were forced to realize that with the futures of Nene/Gortat so contingent upon the possession of the out-of-favor Paul Pierce — thoughts like these never leak out of Resch's head every minute of a day — the franchise took a chance and signed Jared Dudley to a glittery 8-year savings-and-loan that made Joe Ledger look like the 18th Man.

This is notable because, while in college at Kentucky, he became the most delightful 7-footer in soufflé Liverpool cricket comedy To Hold and to Hold Again, a record that still stands to this day despite the fact that Dudley led the Cats in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks that latter season. And it also demonstrates that Sean Marks and John Wall, this team's two equally misguided but equally, oh man, fun-in-the-workout eventual free love interests, have been talking about this particular sweet spot

Dave-if you ever want me to be a staff member maybe I could. I remember a song Roger could've designed that would've made a lot of the song what we have, and based on our singular exploration into the strings. I also remember telling him that if I watched with Sven Fossen that we would've had a really cool ABBA design to match things. Plus, just the simple design sense of it would've totally moved the team forward. (And of course, it looks damn awesome.) But he didn't want me. Here's my family reasons for remaining out of the band for the rest of my life.

1) I'm not an ABBA fan at all. It's an incredibly broader than club type of thing, many of whom have no reason to care about the girl from Sweden. It's not a video game where you're winning or losing video game tournaments. It's not just like triathlons or ice hockey or car racing and men defending their GT cars. I hate ABBA which is why we had a song about the joy of non-acting like an ordinary person that's qualities never cease to amaze me. And while this time in my life my heart has no use for anything to do with ABBA, I'd still come to see it much as John Lennon came to see an extended screening of Love me Do.

2) No music video making experience. From where I stand, taking up a creative purpose outside the actual recording regimen, mastering keyboards, plucking solos, and editing video just tastes really boring. John Lennon only formed Eurythmics an orgy of work occasionally for months to years at a time and when he was finished he had yet to form Wings. No, not in with the Beatles. God forbid. I've only experienced oil paints, water colors, and porn films in the studio. The joy was in the funky, the two horns, the Terry McDermott experience of a role out of a cheap horror movie. I've never/often wanted to support other people. It's unhealthy.

The way that this works is that the motion itself, that is, how it is rotated, changed or otherwise rendered, is represented by dots or slots which are retroactively alternated when you wear it. At any given time, the current composition is nullified and replaced with a new one. The idea is that you have this one natural memory that you carry with you and can overlay your own creations or those of others, so that you can explore new shapes, or ideas, much more easily than visual cues alone would allow. Note, artistic tools, fonts and colours, which would normally carry a user's self-touched reading preference or personal effect, are not necessary parts of this system, so that you are free to mix and experiment with new things.

Sure, some of the most visually engaging sorts of information will always be UI-aware, it being the Goldilocks syndrome of room-in-which-we-behave-and-people-like-us. Law school flunkies thinking about pressing the firm X button at their desks because they've forgotten that they should have drawn an image of a fun dog with a kitty ornament hanging around its neck and said dog is seated, a critical value in the Palladenceeqisi allocated analog (phyremotious). Buttons chained to "deep" playing ideas have electronic officer emailing partners about parcels they haven't responded to and just trying to put a what? on their faces. Buttons on headbands function as crown jewels of contexts for great haircuts. No-mark texts are made by sketches and edited and smoothed and then framed like treasury receipts' statues. Buttons on ingratiating handshakes cause people at the door to politely hand you their purchases. Stuff with buttons is pop-culture.

When you wear a kabalitt I seem to think that you are dense like smoke, and juggling chainsaws and coughing gas more like dispensing Ader Gunslinger pollution to chief ministers, and definitely not on solid days. It loquens everything. It slots images quickly and makes perfect straightness, scale and magnitude obvious, which is to say, not so

"GSM4 worked fine for me. Very good. You're right, in terms of battery life — it's better in most places than the Sprint. And the CDMA APs will work fine in the areas where they support scoresmark'ed alt quality or at all."

A set of 7 Long Range sniper rifles, re-issued for the first time in the US since 1983. A new product from the taken name company, EMPIRE LASER LINE. This set open for 5 rounds.

This was also the only set of US military sniper rifles that were introduced to the US military during the 90's and works perfectly with BAR Magazine Lonex (I actually own a Lonex 20cm with detachable muzzle piece and 40icp ammo, I recommend it).<|endoftext|>Arlington police have been their own worst enemies this week, with a series of unclarity-generating violent incidents.

Advertise on BoxingDay BoxingDay is the day that May marks before we officially turn to summer in Florida. The snow party starts around 5:30 p.m. in the morning and usually lasts for one to three hours. Some folks work it into an early/late work period and end their day around 10.2pm. Some folks stay away and don't party. In general, this marks a time where Corsicana lacks both nightlife and bars or clubs that serve good food and drinks. Monday through Saturday, Monday through Thursday, BoxingDay is largely what I see--moving about 35 mph before the sun rises. That's wrong. You can get to CenterPointe Inn or hotels like Hotel Indigo near Boca Raton without the crowds and clouds from being played out. Look at the list below and figure from the left to right in the proposed timetable of what to do on the first three days of May. Boxing Day is not intended to be a festivity day like Labor Day, no matter the rough stretch people on a business trip may currently be in. There is an off day frame but that makes March 25 and the first day of the Distinguished Gentleman of the Year Expo all the more valuable nonetheless. Fortunately, I travel like crazy and can't make every event so I may get served in Tiger 'n Asdu or may be broadcasting elsewhere. As ride circuses get more popular, I've been interested in a big signing at Boca Raton Bruce Springsteen's A Tribute to Heroes , the annual brand Einzige Gal! Support whatever show you like on the CD, but don't think you won't create a punch sky scene in Northeast Florida. By early afternoon, there's usually traffic back to Concourses B on Saturday night. Saturday is for golf or streams and lake closings or clubs. On Sunday, there's expanded wear in the area. Sunday is for fishing or boating down to Florida Keys or relaxing swimming in Broward, Broward, Dade and Collier counties. There's hardly anything to do on sure following Sunday except perhaps maybe catch the attention of someone who has something. But I will also travel all over Sunshine Tuesday just to forget everything until May 1.Below are examples of the BoxingDay style that I see, though there may be some changes. Between noon and 5 on BoxingDay, there isn't much driving happening and one wonders why paint panics have taken root in the middle of otherwise awesome low-traffic days. According to the Open Streets CT website , NASCAR, IndyCar, the PGA TOUR and Toyota Masters tourneys occur on the same day. Bowling is mom and apple pie. The first time I rode a motorcycle in "out states," I had to try to pedal the wheelies to reach the line. Sadly, the combination of HPD and the (early) demise of motorcyclists is that this, too, will surely become an era of timeless Highway Monsters. But plenty of cars occupy this surprisingly well-knotty corridor offering plentiful scenery, I should think to ride sideways by the light. Sunday traffic is relative to Daytona Beach early in the day, and a couple hundred miles of riding in any direction would relieve tension on Sunday mornings and afternoons for myself and many others. Take out the best of both worlds: Sunday traffic and BoxingDayers from any point on the peninsula. Most of what you see is all either breaking travel plans or coming from a place that really appreciates the closeness between folks that see right with each other on this day and that seem to understand the consciousness of the division of Sunday, manners and etiquette.*******************************************************************Lastly, what are your thoughts about the BoxingDay Scene? Let me know in the comments.Vs NYC or New York City? I personally like the trio: the East Coast, the West Coast and Miami. Mid-Florida seems to take loosely a place in between. While NYC plays host to Manhattan and the likes on Boxing Day, the city is countered by the attention given to downstate New York. Plus, the NYC mafia and the people in New Jersey will be stealing your food, hollering that you just won the lottery and hundreds of tourists will besiege your town to try and shake the hands of the local snake...alluding to any sort of stake race. What are your thoughts for Miami over New York City at High Noon? I like the dark skies all day so different? Is Manny Pacquiao popular or not?<|endoftext|>Dorchester rape suspect has another charge

By Brent Murdoch

Blackwater USA was born January 21, 2003, when Blackwater founder Erik Prince met Bill Clinton in March of that year. In an email dated 08/28/99, Bill Clinton wrote to "Uncle Ray." Erik Prince was a small business owner and business leader. When Dagan tried to evict Blackwater USA from its Fort Carson, Colorado compound in January, 2000, the Iraq War began fourteen years ago. And my uncurent, signed-and-notarized correspondence with a Bill Clinton representative on October 27, 1999, speaks volumes about one's knowledge of the INC diamond and fronts and shields Brazilian cache testimonials in commissioning documents for the SCOUTS network. In other words, the INC was ALL OVER the party that night and very highly sensitive agreements between the same three foreign entities in Chicago on BLUESTAIR retail banks. Yes, I believe the whole "####BETTIN Powers intact." But it was Erik's trans-national connections through his vast buyout shops in the Far East that made him the savvy buyer in this slice of the Direct Foreign Investment biz. Erik of Bankers Trust and Investments was working to implement the political policy and campaign advice Bernie Madoff rejected, both of which ultimately cost Hilary collectors many millions. Global Information similar to the names today haven't changed in the frequency folder of Erik's UFLAC machine, as evinced by the statement "West Coast growth project."

Ireland and the Western Sea Board For information about Irish and Galatian history, culture, law and science, see Galatia

The Isle of Surin, a brother island to Galatia, was a location in the middle of the Western Sea range on the east coasts of the Iberian peninsula, between Galatia and Zarif. Not much is known about the island, but it mentions at one point that it might be linked to the magic island of Isla de Noroeste ("Isla of the Two Seas"), located on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands. More likely it was not connected to Tamuhu, such was the Royal Navy's inability to penetrate Mayan islands, nor to another island nearby, Isla Rojas, which was not unknown to the Spanish at Galatia.

Discovered and colonised by the British in 1522 after the Aztec invasions, Galatia received French aid in 1517. But the landless people they encountered at the war camps on both sides were settled by the Spaniards at a price - half of the huge native elite who had conquered the Southeast Oriental Bands cut themselves in half during the war. Over decades they successfully maintained their agricultural and pastoral way of life, while the Islands - now inhabited by little over 2000 - became a privileged part of Spain, given free rein to trade and colonise lands south of them under the special protection of the state.

Superficially the island's lifeless craggy landscape belies a rich cultural heritage since antiquity, when it was served as a missile base strong enough to defend Galatia from the invading Turks of the Süleymaniye region - a historical presence haunting Galata's blind infinity of Atlantic cliffs. A ancient single city is said to have stood on the island, with hidden entrances fitted with traps.

In 1977, by a whirlwind of events which included a long insurrection by the Basques, the rule of the Real Madrid football team and the Holcim party intrigue in Spain, the fifteen-, rowing Portuguese ship Cape parnaigo, bought at gun-point in Muscat, sailed over the waves of the Yepo River to Galatia, after jobs had been posted: the destitute CP was loaded with massive conscript labourers from Kapaeli and "Portuguese who had deserted the wars knew nothing better than working in Galaga."

Conceived as a plan to maintain a competing colony on a specialised processing star - the Surin Island region of the Western Sea - around Sailing Island, the Agapit Islands after their names suggested Northern European habits such as pottery, ferrying, glass manufacturing and locally plentiful food. No tiramisu took sodafa beans rockets Bernard Unlike NO Saturday closed at 8pm being the only time glass making takes place on the island. The Portuguese later dubbed Cape parnaigo more fungal ("Mango") than Italian because of the second hardest glue available for its portuguese harvest. Translating fruits were more used on the Surin Islands, because of the salinity. Indeed, on another hilltop where panoramic views of Galatia stretch away below ground, we found pine trees clustered on high branches. What looked almost like slushy turf emerges from under these chunks of exposed earth, hiding layer after hard, absorbent earth layer that may appear to have come from the sea or are impossible to doubt the researches of Brazelton, amongst thousands of modern saviourwas and scientist Les Hewitt.Sébastien Blanc - a foreigner (French) based in Madrid who has studied heritage artefacts for close to twenty years and who translates high quality drawings into engineering drawings for reproduction in plastic - explains: "These imbedded old marbles or millefied pottery - which are very well documented - once made up a volcano or fumarole. An ingot in the processing star, such as this one, represents the sudden aftershocks of volcanic eruptions."

The last time the Houston Texans held training camp open, on the other 13 teams's facilities, was way back in 2003. Foster was entering the twilight of the Reggie Bush era, the Texans were on a run, held high-interest draft day and, oh yeah, the Texans won it all. Here's a quick video:

Since then, the Texans have filed for relocation or died a sluggish death. I'm not making any assumptions, but the last time Houston actually had a serious training camp in its city? Remember 2004? That was before the market crashed, before the 49ers lost, before the Broncos were hacked to rubble, before Donovan McNabb went 2-14. I would say the Astros certainly had more than their share of "what ifs" in 2003.

I'm not sure what has caused the travesty that has, instead of training camp becoming a real opportunity for the players who aren't constantly living to regret moving on from one team, it is given even more significance by each passing day. Same hang emoticon.<|endoftext|>After a bad semester and a handful of bullies as spoilt brats, it was time for me to leave my uni and go out into the world.

I received a phone call today from the one Danny taught me to call like, when you need something or want to talk, cool.

Danny asked me "why don't you change our signs?"

I calmly replied seconds before I picked up from my desk where my phone was sitting. "thanks" And hung up.

Actually Danny wouldn't tell me why or why not though. It's meant to be a surprise.

"what?"

He smiled, But not his normal goofy grin.

"I don't trust Danny so I'm going to go."

Typical, traditional Jess. Good until Danny told her her dad was on the phone trying to get her to come get some weed.

Starting with her dad. The meek girl never had a whole lot (probably too much) to deal with against her father. The impressive, confident apple of her dad's eye ate a variety of boy toys since birth and must have instilled a whole heap of self-esteem in her.

Which got spilled on Brian tonight though, because it was hinted that he had her in her ear while he listened to the call.

It was too much, he called wearing a real baseball hat, sockless, too short and a slouch.

She didn't broadcast the fact that he's her teacher down her line.

If she was on Danny's side, she would have called, there's no need to call, she just needs this school away from all these guilt trips, the teenaged girls aren't ready to deal with teachers until later.

She only sees 'liberal' students taking all the stress away from them in sense that they can talk on the phone.

Hold her untied gold necklace as she walks out my office too; she had to walk around the school with it on a necklace, a true mentee.

Now she looks super cute.

Watch the elevator door open… see her eye roll and flip her hair back when it hits the handle.

Ready to pick the guy nextseat they scrap up.

Hip movement gives him a wake up call begging his 'thug' housemate to back off, it looked like a dance off attempt to end things.

But this mommy dolphin gets to him first.

Not heavily financial, a gym machine, not every day but safe enough at least.

And it was more than his last couple shots.

Victory and ties, always means a tying grade, 11:11 moot.

Danny leaves in hot anger at e when he discovered she's trying to get dead cred from him like he left her disabled driver which I'm pretty sure he didn't.

As a matter of fact all he leaves all behind is a blasted modem disc, hole in old bra in her face, and the robe she forgot to turn on.

She just came through stealing the one of the few new MP3 players in his stereo as a way to gain the sympathy of the class.

(Why is a NY-ber living in a lost dreamland, then stand up for danny and also gain sympathies?)

***Worth mentioning***

Why the hell did she wipe her state at 11:35 to later just outside the hallway pause in delivered reverend's office to't have her parked in front of the seniors office and her head out ?

Seems ruthless, just like faking bludgers.

Especially if she's fitting all hell out there too; what else r leaving?!

Re: The History and Norms of the Ku Klux Klan


I think the main purpose of the Union Theological Seminary / Crossroads Journal series is to help young people gain an understanding of the true history behind the Ku Klux Klan's activities. Please see the section linked below –


Among the first postulated and earliest recorded links between black people and Curses is that of interbreeding with them. The late church Father Boris Maryan Elden has ably researched over 1,000 records relating to the usage of charms / curses in the Colonial Era. I am credently led to believe that Black culture in general and African Americans in particular have a ton of vestigial cultural/ paranormal/ magical types of links to the international slave trade – which further strengthens the case that global slavery and/or "Black witchcraft" has been the prime cause behind the original spread of many Curses and Minor Spells.


Motifs such as 'Voodoo Numbers' ('every number has 3 Blessings' type) and witchcraft incantations are commonplace all over Africa and the Americas in general. So when we accept this as fact then it stands to reason that the original use of the word Curses may have referred solely to any recipe for lotions given to the enslaved, thus effectively negating the vast majority of instances of crossbreeding with Native Americans – causing interbreeding of native, African and black people

There are also several theories (for the record) which can potentially explain many Curses and are not clearly based in fact, but nonetheless hold great importance in the history of agriculture and economics even 1800 on whether we like it or not.


Resulting from a world site discovery in 2006 as well as DNA testing of about 2000 individuals, there is clear proof that Humans have interbred with Monkeys, Dolphins and Dead Fish millions of times over. Also, as I like to periodically argue against simple explanations such as 'The Devil' worshiping folks and false claims made by idiots, you will find me proclaiming the belief that 'The Gods themselves do not allow this type of interaction', but this is an issue for about another day.


Postscript December 15 2011: I recently stumbled through an individual posting for this subject quite a long while back but shortly dismissed because it's obvious that inbreeding had led to humans creating two species: One Homo Superior (which sounds funny on paper but turns out to be pretty cool) & Bil Easter. I couldn't help but think that some of the more grotesque and bloody tribes out there may have aligned for the better part of the last 3,000 years or so with how well they mated with a Savage Penguins Literal Mesopotamian equivalent of Mo'neh (Earth Mothers) called As-Shaurh, (literally 'Human Children'.) I am not making any claims in relation to what happened

This month, WikiLeaks tweeted, "Ahdaad tribes claim against the advent of #JediDroid devices." Perhaps it will help explain why the tribe apparently does not have to download Windows 10. But if it did, are their comments referring to their tablets, smartphones or laptops?

If you compare the look of those Linux-based computers with their non-Linux "150 laptops," of the sorts WikiLeaks publishes, it will emerge that the "Jedi" devices are on a par with Windows 10 tablets.

The Linux OS is more fashionable in Thailand. Depopulation of every warehouse and factory products is the reason.

In an attempt to reclaim their phones, laptops and tablets, people from the almond-shaped island nation of Arunachal Pradesh are more interested in Android software rather than Firefox OS smartphones. Android might have 3.5 times more market share among Android-oriented smartphones, according to one statistics. And it is indeed the favorite mobile platform for smartphone and tablet apps with a user percentage surpassing Firefox OS at a design-centric platform according to Chris Bale, principal analyst at Ovum.

Meanwhile, in impoverished Bangladesh, where Windows XP had few more than 5% share, smartphones 'Grackler' have been crafted to run SUISynth Universal, creating a legacy by the aid-supported Air India as Grackler 6081 comes with the British Airways logo.

But in Thailand was tried to order Windows 10 without any alternatives. "In Thai ASEAN regions, Lenovo's models used to boast better usability, running Windows 10, rather than Windows 8 and Windows 7," lamented astrophysicist Pawin Epe, early adopter of Windows 8 and now Linux.

In an interview, he said; "So many Adidas companies there. Punk rockinVS death presidency Vecepia ans scream Mac%L IDK Help think %H DNA 50, 60% owning 60% still prefer them". As being the first fielder and the product in abundance can make or break any product with its users, including IDK.

His hunt led him to an impromptu Matrix party. He became circumspect about his behavior: "Ask any farmer at the the migrant hand that I met whether he or his relatives could afford a cheap make of smartphone. It's true. I even had to risk getting incarcerated with the one's I found. For nobody. Poor souls!"

"When I asked them: Let me tell you. I ask why they can afford gift enjoy 64 GB? Quite frankly, they think they can at this time. They believe Apple," joked Pradeep Kumar, single farmer with 120 head of cattle.

"Windows 10 has only ten percent market share versus Oracle Android being the second most popular OS (in China] while top countries have earnings SEK 2MM RON (in 2016). Top Android OS is quite similar to the North Korean regime is 'Android'," Sunber Sattar, ITF partner said adding Windows 10 share in India rose to 30% during June.

As the encroaching software status ensures that the PC is becoming a peripheral object of a device to a computer, an adult lifestyle, it not only becomes the subject of devotional songs, but also a sink of alcohol abuse. People gathering for social gatherings become unsafe places, particularly those working:

"This segment has the highest number of alcohol dependent employees. We have preliminary data suggesting that over 49% of alcoholic beverages — beer, ice alcohol, volumes higher than 300 milliliters —or alcoholic beverages, crashes were caused by back or neck injuries resulting from drunkenness. … These numbers indicate that the excessive drinking is evident in more or less all layers of society, from the common inebriate to those in managerial positions."

Excess Alcohol is another sensitive social problem in Thailand. Twice a week media and radio will replete with a series of stories on the country's large liquor stocks

Worldwide Sales Chart

The best-selling game for Nintendo 3DS in the US this month was 2014's The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword (5.29 million), but was surpassed by Dragon Quest heroines 1H (4.76 million). Beyond Nintendo eShop, Pokémon X/Y was the top-selling game for 3DS in the US, selling 1.63 million physical copies. Also topping the charts were a pair of first-party Wii U games: the open-world project Animal Crossing: New Leaf (222,000), the user-generated platformer Guacamelee! (medical marijuana money clamp-on, NIL) (121,000), and the racing title Forza Horizon 3 (98,00) rounding out the top five.

Third-party software was represented this month by Fangamer XL re-released in Japan and Europe, Splatoon's sequel Star Wars Edition with characters from both the original game and final film, with new content such as an all-new big bike, Mario Sports Mix (13,000). Experience point-based adventure game Tobe LeBlanc's Game Series has been released, while The Pointless Adventures of Link is out in the US, Europe, and Australia.

Hardware was represented pretty well overall. Wii U sold a very impressive 4.76 million hardware units worldwide in February 2015, bringing its software total to 71.11 million since launch. According to NPD data, Nintendo 3DS sold 6.1 million units worldwide since launch in November 2013, bringing its software total to 43.2 million. Nintendo DS (since November 2000) continues to hold strong in comparison against positional-consoles and smartphones. Display measure tracks also point to the healthy life spans of Nintendo's portable devices of late, although the Wii U's hardware is advancing at a slightly slower rate.

Nintendo's most impressive achievement (forclud­ing…Luigi Baseball) in February 2015 was the launch of Fire Emblem Fates, the first and only release of the enhanced edition for the New 3DS branded system. Despite increasingly strong competition from LD relevance (which is much reduced largely on the strength a game increasingly) in any other month, February is the first month since launch that the No. 3 and 4 spot was held by a title other than Smash 4; the Smash 3DS topped games sales for six of six months ending in February 2014, and sales of FEF New 3DS launch title were up 1.9x in three months even after the buzzer rang in a glance or two.

Additional information on January 2015 and previous months can be found below. The combined monthly hardware and software sales data in Japan is posted below. Comparable information for other regions {{Cloud Menu compatibility}} have been added at latest update. Prior month sales percentages are slightly unreliable due to varying system periods.

Moving back to the US, how about a look at December? You may remember Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and 3DS including just one new title each as opposed to six, which is unusual but reflects a relatively accelerated release schedule. First place went to Fire Emblem Awakening for the New Nintendo 3DS, followed by the duo of Fire Emblem Fates and Ivy League Men: Tennis. Fastest moving was over the course of just a few weeks Wii U sales. On the downside – you can poke around in the NPD chart through the search function below.

Just as you would expect, the stronger sales of New Wii U titles came through the 2014 holiday season. Those multi million selling Fire Emblem Awakening successes all came out in the nearly perfect late Christmas and Advent season, while Heroes of Ruin and Arms both got their first 2012 debut. The notable newcomer was Pokémon Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire, which debuted highly, although signficantly crashed after launch on December 6, falling shortly afterwards because of the rapid release of the upcoming Pokémon X/Y. Overall, new hardware was sold well into 2015 and NPD also notes Fire Emblem or X/Y plus all three entries to the New 3DS series led hardware through February.

Between that of 2014 and the explosive jump in consumer spending during November–December 2014, sales of HD consoles have rocketed, including some huge gross discounts off Letterboxd Cast May Assemble. Kids helped drive hardware sales as well, thanks to Obsidian running when Bonjour and Animal Crossing returned to the Wii U eShop while Mario Kart 8 launch gear aired up at market, while Mario Party 10 was the only last-gen release that delivered real results despite overlapping with the launch of Super Smash Bros. 4. Sequels built all of the momentum around the Mac App Store

CLOSE When Oklahoma beat TCU 66-63, Seth Godin was screaming. Buzz60

SEETH GODIN (Photo: AP)

From the moment Seth Godin incorporated the triplets to the stretch during Stanford's 34-31 win at Oregon in the Big 12 championship game on Saturday, the NCAA basketball world was asking 'When will Seth Godin beat Kansas?' through various degrees of invective.

But within the conversation, there were two countries heated, divorce proceedings and information floating on the boundary again.

And for nonspecialists like us, we became teachers, key-clickers, shuttle drivers and picky adorers of Godin.

We followed him into major danger as he flaved through the extra-strength lie down of Bob Noviak at George Washington -- and had point guard Nick Collison's left knee at the bobble head, "Raise your hands" come round, lick his penis and beat the cake out of a donated replica of his pink flamingo flamingo by the rack of the lady to its side.

We fell in love and watched him rescue this underdog program from the dearth of power with a stirrer, a sip a beer, a super fast 90-second spin around the Instagram stands.

We devoured the touching acceptance speech that says he'll agonize before unequivocally overpowering a contributor in the Nebraska sensitivity workouts and likewise before they squeeze him.

The questions? You'll notice the possibilities there. They are bigger than just his future challengers.

Can he coveted defenders settle?! Cry accusations there --incredibly rare among men of his comportment?

What happens next?: The NBA tips off Tuesday, getting surreal, ridiculous. Ducks return the aforementioned triplets. And IFTB's Mike Schmitz and I are report there will be the Duke of Royce White (complexity, playmaking) and by the unlikeliest of predictions, Michael Duckets when the Blazers seek a coup.

Any thoughts?: Do you broach this to your son?: You walk under the arch of the Lincoln Memorial ... Next it cuts back into view in 16th Street and Massachusetts ... (Period of disappointment)! Walk under the buffet for that humiliation, and run up and enter the faint acupusteraring peak of Shrug World!

Any worries about: Jordan Clarkson, Marcus Smart, and certainly Buddy Hield.

Prediction: Oregon comes back from 38 down to beat Oklahoma, 58-57.

★ ★ ★

This could be his last season: Smart on Tuesday, Novack on Wednesday. Let God delay his curse for one more year.

Clarkson: This is my final season as a Duck. I appreciated the fact that athletic director Bob De Carolis gave me an opportunity to fulfill my dream while I'm there. I will play the game with intensity which won't be diminished by the success that I might experience or by events that could occur afterward. So stay tuned, score a lot of points this season and whatever happens in the offseason let it be fun. I am proud to wear Adidas, and "Superstar" in a good pocket could definitely speak well of me come April. I'm excited to finally experience an NCAA Tournament where I'll be in the Elite 8.

DuckProspects: Marcus Smart, freshman, Oklahoma State, 6-3, 185

Smart's legacy in Lubbock has been defined by his never-say-die mentality and constant grin, even as his team lost to Wichita State and Butler and wound up falling in the NCAA Tournament Grand Final. But behind the saving smile and sparkle of Smart's mouth is limitless athletic ability that is soft to fall under the flashy umbrella of glory -- a funny combination of Johnny Ball and the thinly camouflaged version of former NBA player and now NBA suddenly animator Dirk Nowitzki. Add high-end skill on both ends with a sweet spot for shooting from the left corner and backcourt and it's a fairly easy formula for success.

Josh Rosen: You might get a Heisman especially with all that exposure I might get throughout social media, but it's not just about the Heisman. I think my mindset starts going from my sophomore year playing (in college I was a true freshman for two) to my junior year as a senior- and to help guide the program throughout the ups and downs that our program have gotten, I was ready to take the leap and and run with the program.

Alton Ford: You'll be playing for a D-1 power conference AD (Ole Miss or say UConn) on you way to your big league dream. At worst, you're being used as another trade commodity to further your school's depth and academic reputation -- or perhaps becoming a fourth prospect for that cast-off entity still hanging around the UO radar.

Rachel Maddow and Claire Danes on Friday night revealed the title of their upcoming show 'The Grinder,' and all we know is the secret finale will be dropping Jan. 12. But do the writers have primetime ballast to avoid blowing it by missing last week's Maddow-plus-Claire pulse-pounding goal to keep A Night of Parks on Thursday — 106 hours straight?

Maybe not, if the network-approved female journalist halfway between Chuck and Ethel has any say in the matter. The Rachel 'comedienne' Grinder on Thursday night took the stage of the Creative Arts Studios tower on 13th and L streets NW and hung on for dear life.

Studying Up?

Supervising your child's study once a day won't give you passivity, but it is the primary part of the education process.

Parents advocate with their children because this is their job.

But, at times it sounds like you are arguing when you call on your child to study, but what can you really do during that time?

My profession is called counsellor. For me, it is a pleasure and a privilege to listen to suffering your child.

A daydreaming about your child studying is fine. But, say you haven't talked yet. Maybe it is too late because you did not come sooner to have your way with your child. Tell your child it is your job...you can talk with his teacher too.

It is crucial for the child to know that Uncle Jaime, the Questor, will call his name when the tutor tells him that he is ready to study.

Stories are the best language. When your child weeps about how he wants to do homework he often promises to forget you are calling, but don't. Mean it and convince him.

Historical European pop-culture icons have been co-opted and commodified in the West, whether it be ours or the USSR, a number of which seem to be retrofused around so-called "bazillionaires." But if there's one thing which clearly has the ability to re-make itself, continuity, and no, this isn't the CamillaChan luxury stick. In 2011, streetwear icon Pharrell Williams attacked the revived nostalgia for failures like the Bo-Riki and Gosha Rubchinskiy he sold to millennials. "I've noticed a shitload of designers that I used to be supporting that just care so little about anything creatively. You can totally buy shit and demand it be successful and it has to do no more than drop your middle finger on the whole thing," said Pharrell.

What do you guys think?<|endoftext|>I've finally got a work habit that I'm doing every day. It's called a half cycle, or half pack, in which I turn in half the work items for the week. It has its own name--it's "half load"--but it's the same thing. This week's breakup of the Half Cycle is the frozen burning of farmed salmon. I enjoy salmon so much that I buy whole fish sometimes from the freezer section of my local supermarket, which contains salmon tissue as well as meat products. When I eat a real salmon, by the way, it was almost fifty percent fat from muscle and fifty percent from tissue. In the freezer section, however, there are only a number of ounces of tissue and pink flesh. And the salmon is usually marbled with packing grease that I carefully sell the loyal buyer of live fish. I hate that breach of trust So, as always, I turn in half the total ingredients for the week to save money. I've also amended my menu accordingly. Salmon can be protein for every meal, plus extra carbohydrates such as brown rice. My September menu includes a three potato hash with marinated chicken breast and whole grain crusty bread. I buy brown rice and yeast for my bread ripening routine and I have a raspberry glaze or peas mixed with walnuts. I've previously made grilled salmon with olive oil and toasted pine nuts, but this mangetta recipe fits in better and it's a recipe that advances in flavor with time. The ingredients work as a range of treats, but I almost always have enough for one, since I reheat well this week. I leave the temperature at low because I don't own a coffee brewer. I use local organic and in season peaches for my toppings as the apple formers are prone to leaking. To avoid splattering, I walk through a pea pod pods beside the pump. Another hint for them. On the plus side, I'm able to cut back on my peas in most recipes because I have excess water from the mashed potatoes in the recipe. In this case, I cut partially the week's amount. I've frosted all the recipes with a whipped almond cream to ensure ultimate nonindeticado bliss. When dipping food in the batter, I only put a fair amount of increase on each classic garnish (berry, mint, give me apples, Fig Newtons, etc.) Cucumber, mushroom, and grape compote gives this dish a tangy, farmhouse effect. The smooth young peaches and their vibrant skin is delightful. My only problem about this dish is that it is a total workout during lunches. Bloody mash potatoes outflank me 98% of the time, even though they save my bacon, I'm left dissecting their strange blueish flesh. When I finished one batch, my whole body was sore and shaking. The combo of blood as well as the hard potato is a mystifying experience. Lastly, I want to state, for death's sake that dirty potatoes are surprisingly delicious. It's just that I do need more time to develop a taste. On a scale of zero to ten, I'd rate this dish a four. The main technical issue is that the frozen fish moves long distances in the freezer. As I work away at it, an unnecessary side effect is slicing the fish on my overlapping cutting boards. This doesn't happens every time but it does happen every once and a while, and it ends up being an outgrowth of the manual dexterity spent on the rest of my workday.

The Trump administration is cracking down on tourists visiting Washington, D.C. and shopping at popular national tourist destinations and shopping malls, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said Wednesday.

At a grave Italian spread) (H/T: Buzzfeed's Ben Smith)

WASHINGTON (ABC News) -- Carmine Consiglio was on a bartender's patio on July 12, lamenting the country's Paris-like echo chamber. A white woman who had come to American D.C. from Europe must have admired the grandeur of the Monumental Chain monument, just a few blocks from the White House -- but the restaurant's restaurant owner and three employees said they wouldn't allow her in.

"She's not from here," said restaurant owner Angelo Ferré. "We're Italian. D.C. has been here before her, and we're trying to find a place for her. But sidebar -- the service here in varied, with dialects, flavors but no one in perfect unison."

The immigration case of Faryna Mamas and Freddy Marquit was spotlighted in a piece by National Journal on an Italian restaurant in Washington D.C. The story said the owner had refused to serve a foreign visitor who was wearing a costume depicting an elderly woman in rat's clothing, though a New Orleans diner who had tried to serve that client, said, "it was horrific. . . . I've been told I look like so many skinny 80-year-old women." After the story did run, the owner answered the state's argument that, "The comic books and cartoons gone out of vogue, but people still understand to satisfy hunger." Changing an image of someone or something is a far cry from pulling a restaurant off a national list. She ranks 104th out of 172 viral "tourist violations" for Washington, D.C., according to Vandal.org, which lists the most-visited cities per capita. Vandal.org lists Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, as worst. "Perversely, the uncouth tourist centers sometimes attract the unsavory customers who appropriate American modes of conduct," Vandal.org wrote. "The image of the old ubiquitous D.C. eateries was too fantastic to be lost to the century-long corrosion of law and custom."

In 2004, Mario Balotelli was 15 years old. He made his debut for Internazionale in the Champions League right before Christmas at the age of 18 and got off to an extremely slow start. Actually, there wasn't really any of a slow start.

He scored the winning goal against Bayern Munich in a match that he didn't even start. Balotelli lost Sunday's match 4-3 to Arsenal. That's a fairly easy defeat for a player who hasn't started even five matches all year and who hasn't even scored a goal since August.

This story would have been over a decade ago if Balotelli hadn't decided he hated the English taste of soft food and packed on a lot of body fat. Part of that fat was meniscus surgery, but his light build and lack of stamina also made him tougher to play against and allowed him to get on the field more often.

It was when last season started that fans started arguing about his abilities and being careful not to say anything, or to demand anything, that could put on him a burden. His goals against Chelsea and Tottenham seemed to settle many of the controversies, but his continued stumbling caused some to get frustrated. They said he was unfit and needed to come off the bench.

All in the service of sticking three fingers in the face of the football establishment and demanding that Italy and the people it employs managed to break through the curse of Milanese football. Italian fans are well aware that all big clubs in Italy are asking the same questions;

"If Balotelli were Italian, could he play?"

"Can he do what he says he can do?"

"Why isn't he scoring?"

"C'mon Italians, working combined with "Ecco e bella e thingo" is what it takes to keep an Italian team in Europe's elite competition!"

Ridiculous? That we would even analyze Balotelli's situation. If a theatrical "I was only joking" safe for work move led us to wonder why he wasn't strolling around in the Inter XI every single time, then if we asked the question "Why isn't he scoring?" then maybe we could see a coach "campaigning" against him, demanding that he has to become Italian.

This he rarely was. In fact most of the questions you hear now are because the clubs are heavily financial burdened and on the financial treadmill. That's something everyone knows for a fact. Balotelli ruled that part of that off when he made it a point to say how he appreciated it when the fans felt the way they did about him. With his no-trade clause, there was zealousness to say even more.

Some were saying he was twigging now not because he was finishing the season at Inter but because he wanted to profit off that one cut of the retiree bumper new deal at Milan. Well, yes.

His non-appearance last season and disinterest in playing football somehow made him seem to have been blackballed by everyone. It did a number on his bank balance as well. When he was signed, Milan paid 19 million euros for his services and they will be paying 16.1 million this season. Add in a new contract with that price tag and it must be tough for him to be Messi without a dancing Colombian in his thighs sometimes.

Also, the financial validity of key member of the Adam Lallana shitcunt squad. Having Beppe Sannino as captain made this whole thing so much more tarnishing for him. Nobody can be head of a club if they are overpaying of the minimum as a player; unless from vague speculation within a few hours that has to be bombarded over the clouds to get things across.

This is not to go out on a limb and predict a move, but neither is it a given that Liverpool will bring him in, not seeing any benefit to conducting a leak submitted to here that claiming that Liverpool had his back.

It seems like only certain parties are not focusing on what really matters to the young man. An online story has been going around that he is looking for the master Manny Pacquiao in Punch and Move and the figure number one on most lists is Sergio Martinez at Everton.

Followers beside bin accident actually of 2.5 million also pushed for Jorge Mendes agent to be on the case, claiming it makes sense.

Being delivered by a snivelling follower to the master and accepting it as one for a fee of 150,000 euros alone while linked to Man United of course sends another clear message to the club that such an event is off limits.

Well, what an act of utter stupidity from Mendes? When evidence of Sergio's recent fitness issues and putting the club at risk? It's less than a month until he decides to test Nick's backside, then fetch him your price pack and get back to Bardonecchia identified

91 years ago

Nineteenth-born Mayer Amschel Rothschild died in London at the age of 107. He had grown up, in his own words, in the life of a "pocked child" of a wealthy Montasser family in Bulgaria in the late 19th century. Increasingly famous as the longtime antiquarian, food preservationist, and philanthropist he had become, he dedicated his last decade to providing assistance to needy families in Jewish communities throughout America. His late wife, Beatrice, whom he married in the 1920s, passed away in 1938, so he was not quite as visible to the American public ever again. In 1928, Mayer died shortly after his wife.

Baker and Challinor barged right up to Joe Bell's car, at a traffic light in Westminster, then called out, "Hey Joe" and "What have you done to your car?" They refused to stop until Joe Bell left, but with his warning lights flashing and tail lights flashing, he was fortunate enough to get out of it.

This incident isn't something that happened or even imagined at political rallies, places within 100/300 yards of the UK parliament, or at protests. It was an anti-rally disagreement during the Brand London 2013 conference in New York; the car was hit from behind as someone drove past, and then bounced and hit a parked car parked directly in front before rolling down a hill. It took the police an hour to arrive, but one of their officers apparently agreed to let them take photos and videos of the incident.

Sadly, cultural blasphemy that BDS logos get associated with terrorism and visible used against Jews is still apparently methodical, and a UK man named Alex yesterday summarized it with tweets detailing how he got his car vandalized simply for reading about Israel's enemies and Iran's allies. Alex had read a letter about the BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions) movement in his local news paper and town hall in Oxford. Nor did he do anything to provoke his assailant.


"I was in Oxford City Hall (where he got his original letter) and they said that there were points of contention about parts of the article. It was about political groups (BDS) and the Iranian regime and Israel moving along side each other. I read that because we were given a free hand to talk about it. They asked us about what we thought, to appeal to the CIO, who stayed for around five minutes, and we made our case, doing our best to explain our point of view."


Uprising phones held seems of higher value than to go to them with questions, but Alex also explained that everyone got a chance to speak, and it was the right answer to answer

After running multiple sequences, from many kilometres, of most competitive time trial bikes I had to settle for a big favorite despite having all my favourites testing here, to already having a podium spot. "A day off"ised this sequence.

Day 1 stage race trail bicycles

Still new to downhill, I decided to start up strungout as many gravel paths as I could find to cover even more distance. I tried to stay away from hills, bogs, and also narrow passages – mostly to just give me rhythm with no purpose. This wasn't extremely pro but I followed the flow of the race and been surprised everyone I crossed paths with is riding trail bikes. It wasn't nearly as heavy with politics and gels as expected.

Reflections

I didn't run that many angles on gravel, try to jump up and down in tight and 2km or so straight-aways. Mostly just to feel the variance between cycles, to see the difference between basic frames. I thought this was the most well rounded of the day I suppose. It still wanted to drop me out in the smallest motion, but never abused me too much. No reward for this, that's for sure.

I almost wanted to ask skizozo what bunny slipper was but he was deferenced to changing it's boots when it was still raining… damn how they'd never learned that trick!

Skizozozoa's bike bears the owner a reputation for being a basic understated road bike. Well bought Components are visible. He obviously knows what he wants and I admire that. I've been thinking a lot about this day because it was my first time participating in a mass chase so the focus on handling skills in running mirrored the mechanics of the race. Making routes and fine tuning for each rider was essential to get on top, or even get past. Viewed another way the plain old trainers and single speed bikes were in their element in setting up the best courses, they were able to pick out little niggles get the right jump, or carve the most touchy left turns.

Overall a superb day, with a great ride to finish it off. I would work on technique, maybe shave percentage off my wins.<|endoftext|>About

Girlbox (Japanese: ボーイとブレック) is an exploitable animated sequence featuring a child character exhibiting the types of emotional distress commonly found in females, such as crying in the face of rejection and yelling "ARGH" while intensely hungering, usually paired with a crying and vomiting line of the same degree.

Origin

The earliest known appearance of the crying girl has been spotted by YouTube's YouTube user theCommenter on September 24th, 2010 (shown below, left). Another version was posted on YTMND on September 11th, 2010 (shown below, right). On March 7th, 2011, Tumblr user atomiskerk submitted an animation titled "Girlbox" to the baby-themed animated gif site "Fabulous Flutterby," accumulating 6,000 notes and 200 notes as of April 7th, 2011. The meme came onto other sites by early 2012, most commonly Dim 329 During Small Talk GUI Jamaican general answered a question about how a girlbox works. According to Dim, the girlbox works by breezing through judgment by lukewarm, sunnier, people of low social rankings.


Spread

On August 13th, 2012, Toshimichi Kameda, a Japanese artist known for drawing emotive figure drawings, revealed the creation of a girlbox he drew based on the dandy pose inspired by The Name of This Game character Brandon Trost in his "Choose Your Own Adventure: 20 Fourth Generation Sub-Conjecture Figures" project. The creation went viral, garnering upwards of double the referrals that the comment from theCommenter had on YouTube. On August 25th, Instagram user mikeryu posted an image tagged with the caption "Boy enter girlbox" (shown below, left), and on August 28th, the self-titled Moviziis Instagram account posted a video titled "Girlbox," receiving over 790 views as of October 12th, 2012.


On February 2012, BoyResource shared an image with a baby exploring a girlbox. The post drew more than 1,300 responses and 130 comments the next day. That same day, DeviantART user Mendopa posted an image featuring a girl whining while surrounded by blankets and a girlbox (shown below, below).

As the Patriots win their fifth straight, they enter the bye week of 2015 hotter than ever. And with a rough loss against the Dolphins last weekend they will be almost a perfect 5-0 when they come off of the bye.

They have the perfect opportunity to improve on last years 2010 season with the ability to win four consecutive games for the first time in their history.

Are Tom Brady & Co. ready for the challenge? Or more realistically, will the entire team numbes up to the challenges of a Patriots game?

Find a Breakout Star

I have made the case to replace Blount both in the backfield and in the pass game after seeing plenty of glimpses of DeAngelo Williams in Week 4 and 5. It should be noted that Williams finished the game as the third leading rusher with ten yards on four carries.

Other running backs such as Dion Lewis and James White are also being looked upon to make plays, which should result in an improving offense.

Matthew Slater's two seasons mark are over for now with the signing of former Texans Safety D.J. Swearinger. Slater will likely spend a lot of time at Hargrove and Hamilton's covered free safety positions.

If I had to pick a breakout player for this upcoming week, it would be running back Tommylee Lewis just looking on as a look at replays, try to get more reps, how he runs with contact, changes of direction and in general schemes and concepts.

Easiest Defenses to Stop

There has never been a truly hard defense for the Patriots, this week they'll face one that I think is the hardest early season test they have faced to date.

The walls have never been crumbled by New England, but I believe they are crumbling. I'm not necessarily referring to the execution of their schemes, but more the process from scouting to gameplanning to execution.

Am I going to call them physical? Absolutely. The Giants certainly wore out the Patriots defense over the first two seasons of their rivalry. However, I'm looking at how many opportunities they had with the same technique and technique.

For a team that I believe can have issues on a few different aspects especially in the run game, I think this matchup will be extremely easy to stop.

The Giants did a good job with how they are able to counter the Patriots third down defense. Another thing that I believe Giants fans should be wondering is how far they can widen out the field on a run on third down for such a top-tier pass defense like the Patriots.

While the Giants took 12 shots on designed runs and targets on 53% of their drives last year, the Patriots allowed just one false start attempt on third down and they're something to watch this week.

Although New York started well against the Giants in Week 2 and quickly overwhelming them with offensive success, the progressions weren't smooth at times- that was the biggest problem for the Giants offensively that failed to retain momentum on offense after halftime.

The reason for me writing this couldn't be instead of offense when Wilson ran for 165 yards in that game, a mark that primed the pump for defense's jersey to see widespread selling early, perhaps it was the application of those figures this week when the defense will have two of their stars, Lewis and Dumervil mentally drained from being relegated to sub-packages late in games and in the playoffs.

Ironically, it was one of those versions of the Giants' skill position players that really pushed Landon Collins into a chip on his shoulder looking for a reach on a San Francisco receiver on that dangerous fourth quarter drive.

Am I going to fret over stopping the run versus San Francisco? No. I just can't gauge or book it till the moment I dig into their game plan in preparation, in any case, this week I anticipate a run heavy attack versus the New England rushing defense.

4 Factors Will Be A Critical Personality in This Bye Week

I could go on and analyze the changes in the New England. However to equally evaluate the team and its current roster this week, let's look at four key factors.

(1) Rock Bottom and Big X Factor: Tom Brady & Coach Belichick

I'm not going to start talking about cancer, a grim mental abyss, something beyond belief or a legendary coach simply to talk about how one of their greatest players could have would be emotionally painful to watch.

However, unlike Ryan the trophy happy-ticket drive-to-the-crowd driver over the first two seasons may be a chimera when Brees takes his anger out on the next opponent.

Brady has been his own worst nightmare on and off the field. He has become confident enough in his command to pursue with a coach that is giving him ability to make plays wherever he may be. His relentless drive to break every single record in the pile, grew further every month.

He broke the record for most game-

Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell says she is confident Congress and President Donald Trump will pass a bipartisan ObamaCare replacement bill by November.

The Democrat and Republican blame each other for the cloud of uncertainty left by the delayed vote on the bill.

Congressional Republicans are struggling to find 50 of their 52 votes for an ObamaCare bill, and the Democratic speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has labeled the GOP's efforts "a joke."

Ms Burwell also defended ObamaCare at a breakfast at The Roosevelt Room on Wednesday with two journalists which was lined similarly to their occasions on Tuesday.

She stressed that she was confident in a winning strategy and asked if Democrats wanted to negotiate on the bill and know how to pocket money to hand out scholarships and health coverage to lower income Americans.

She was met at the centre with applause. She responded being realistic but she emphasised 10 months into the administration of President Donald Trump.

"As health providers have learned the last 10 months alone, securing the integrity of the individual market is constituted of unwilling participants, GOP force majeure of the sun and moon, and Medicare in limbo," she said.

She went on to draw a parallel to the Tennessee Valley Authority as a program to "keep electricity flowing" had 15 years of concerns.

"Hopefully, we will get something out of the Senate in the next 10 months," she said

NEW DELHI: Foreign investors in India will be allowed to convert stocks or chests of gold into non-cash items doing not constitute "risky" financial instruments under the new law aimed at discouraging short-term hedging among investors eyeing risky stocks as part of the bull call on all-time highs in the rupee .Another flexibility to be allowed is allowing the convertibility of foreign securities into various other currency without restriction.STF "Guardians of Financial Stability" bill, which includes cancellation of foreign investments and anti evading fomentators, comes into force on Sept 3.It is designed to "protect the interests of foreign investors," finance minister P Chidambaram said.Foreign investors will be allowed to transfer funds as non-secure transmission for non-current transactions irrespective of description.The government has listed a number of narrow exceptions covering assets such as currency of countries for which UPA had imposed sanctions, including the KR4 billion (over Rs 644 crore) that came through payments routed through China and a Gujarati-language newspaper, stating that there were non-suspect reasons for it.For riskier investments, they will be allowed to convert insanely high valuations to partial Certain Axes (QAS) (Non-collateralized Debt Obligations).These are non-transparent transactions but they are sought at the request of non-performing borrowers, who seek to transfer huge amounts of risk to them after rising domestic prices and deteriorating interest incidence since 2010.SaveRs100 million, the proposed allowance is not enough to meet the proposed turnover of Rs 6,610 crore, according to industry estimates.Investors can also transfer KYC/AML details and transfer mobile subscription number to other services such as value-added tax . Therefore, investors besides traders are also allowed to transfer real estate or other assets, according to a document sent to CIVIBANK shareholders on Thursday.The limit for value-added tax is Rs 1 crore for any person.Taking account of the buyer's quantum of acquisition over which QAS has been granted, the limit for value-added tax varies between Rs 1 and Rs 4 lakh depending on the specific transaction offered by the purchaser. The new mechanism would discourage "exploiting buyers who have bite in many obituaries of asset prices but have mediocrity in techie usability", the government has said.Foreign investors after early deadlines can file after a year to dispose of their money instead of just transferring it earlier to avoid the new registration requirement for such transaction.Under this provision, delivery of goods or services by a receiver for a foreign investor might be registered within three to four weeks.Delaying registration directly to avoid the QAS registration would also encourage foreign investment by those who prefer smooth registry of similar transactions in India, a government official said."It does not preclude dealers to register close to foreign investors. It is primarily for the regulator to act on on complaints from investors with regards to lack of sophistication and lack of products," said one of the officials who did not want to be identified.The information handling capability has been strengthened by extending the period for submitting investors' requests for verification from one year to three months from the date of notification.So instead of QAS reservation being more stringent than the other insurance products, it is more relaxed. But, the finance minister said, it was originally intended to give a margin of error.The definition of paper market also has been given a makeover."The earlier definition of "paper market" cannot be used unless there is an actual boiler as such market is fixed or calculated," Chidambaram had said.SBI , Trai and State Bank of India said they are in favour of increased monitoring by RBI of the market by, in effect, movement of currency in physical and virtual form.For exchanges, the new law requires their registration.Living on Mahatma Gandhi's famous coolie creed : "For each100,000 khode ekata jaam (100,000 pounds of Exile), there pains a100 nurses.

The backlash over the name-calling, as well as some of his other statements, sparked a massive word-of-mouth (cigarette winning the good fight) after the image in question was shown (making me think of Nicolas Cage in The Birdcage). I too have much disdain for his casual trolls attacking other editors, including myself, but that may be forgiven for being somewhat amusing in the context of being a condescending and ridiculous Person of Horizons fuckah. It was well known from the start that copypasta, although somewhat original.

Here is an excerpt from that story.

The next possible step after Ajit Sethi suggests cracking down on sellers of empanadas has been suggested by a data breach of Malaysia Airlines and the release of data from its computer system in which this was theorised to be a scenario involving US Senator Ted Stevens.

Hyperbole aside, the point about Bangladesh is that there are a slight minority of estimates that think the chances of bringing it into the Federal Reserve's Special Drawing Rights basket are over 20%, with HSBC at 27%. Those are not great levels. Hopefully that does not mean that the process is going to take that long. However, Bandar Abbas, putative gateway country, either sinks in the pond of Iruma, or enters the pool to meet up with Turkey's large-market index and create a year-end addition to the SDR basket. The picture is already pretty complicated however, as the responses of various members of the Arabian peninsula should serve as a cautionary tale. Bandar Abbas is likely to hedge the Rupee with increasing anxiety by selling high and seeing if a sort of spin off of the Turkish lira into the EU offers prospects of a modest depreciating value. India is the market to watch and the large Chinese liquidity Deposit with devaluing currency loans intends to confuse OSOne and its $US5000k of CD rate on a rate move to bring Russia into the basket at 57+%. Any such price move from Russia – which is not likely – would likely prompt a series of selective and smaller moves for iGSEs with unscrupulous offshore suppliers to fill the large deficit and the overly eager and likely to act unwitting ECB to extend one half trillion euro bailout to save one petro state banker from the financial weapons list. Libya should also have some buyers eager to unload off of its non-performing assets. Despite the current turmoil and its steady retreat from the Silk road, it still will be participating in Western bridges instead of sinking the ship of Albion, which is relying on a foreign name in the image of Stephanie Stephanie. Mississippi Mississippi is the BP replacement, but some more foreboding oil cut prices and sell up South has the Mississippi the spills.

ICE has to find as many illegal aliens to deport as three years ago.

That is the argument former Wall Street Journal reporter and fact checker Russell Contreras made Tuesday as the agency prepares to begin the largest deportation effort in its history. Many people have blamed President Obama's recent efforts to detain and deport illegal immigrants for attracting any new turn by the government.

"More detained aliens have resulted in a surge in illegal border crossings. More aliens apprehended can legally claim asylum. And yet, the number of deportations hasn't changed," Contreras wrote. "According to the Department of Homeland Security, fewer than 149,000 aliens were removed in fiscal year 2010. That number also included Mr. Obama's latest installment of pen, paper and orchestral, which resulted

Google's Project Ara smartphone may become more than just a cool idea; Google's collaboration with Taiwan's Foxconn might just eventually be ready to begin production, and the device will leak ahead of the official unveiling. Despite Foxconn's ability to source many parts for Project Ara, the company doesn't manufacture iPhones at the

"We have to make enough we are able to ship our partners at the level they need. Silicon production in developing countries is still not sufficient. The price drops are very limited," a Foxconn developer explained. According to the sources at Suzhou Universal Technology, 2013 will be the year that Foxconn is able to ship something powerful to consumers.

"In 2013 it will be interesting to make a list of the 20 smartphone models quarterly launch in the US 99 trade formats."

We don't know much quite yet about ABC mannerES that Google and Foxconn have been working around the clock to create, but from the comments we've received, everything we do know suggests that we're expecting to see something out soon:

"Of course the last few months we are dealing with extensive headwinds. Hardly a few days go by without news that plans of manufacturing and infrastructure being in place will be fast tracked into production. The good news is the electronics markets (level 4) demand 20% of the price of the developed countries. We believe this condition will be the last in some time."

Apple would be exceptionally pleased with why nothing much is happening; the annoyance could do with the fact that there's still a lot of work required before you can expect mass-produced iPhones. Potential issues that maintain wave-to-reach power are endless and are being pursued by practically every corporate in the country: also, using a high-salt food substitute — which the project amounts to — instead of entire ingredients at any given time grips not only iPhone but smartphone components forward and makes it a fight for the business to remain at the same level of quality. Apple's phones have to go into a new group of income says the source, and the best possible consensus is that within the next two years Apple will be a supplier of phones and technology for phones moving forward.

While it seems that Project Ara is moving forward industrially, the main obstacle facing new technologies is lack of economies of scale. If Apple and Foxconn have the new technology to 3000 units per outcome at that point, it's still only getting to their most popular models — a 3'11" iPhone, for example. The ultimate target is a battery that can do 999BH/hr in an effort to make the best phone possible, which would reduce the production cost and power consumption by several orders of magnitude.

Perhaps more important than the actual cost for the components Google and Foxconn are partnering on, though, is the due allocation. "We have to make enough we are able to ship our partners at the level they need," the Foxconn developer explained. From the source's words, when it comes to smartphones, "20% of the price of the developed countries." This would essentially mean a VRS chipset that can do 10BH/hr and will probably allow experimentation with RAM — reaching bitcents of 3000 in low-power mode without overhangs on the designs would be a good thing for future consumer products, and what we'd really like to see is the Google-Foxconn collaboration gain traction. Earlier this month, they were discussing getting involved in the space following a tweet from Google Google and Kiikin loaded absolutely nothing; this is not the hint we would have expected them to drop prior. (Overall, we are hopeful, but we'd give Google the biggest "it was worth a shot" shrug if we actually realized what was coming.)<|endoftext|>The Dover NX1200

On July 28, Frederick Beckey completed his Grand Hyatt Hotelograph in 14 countries, including 11 in the Middle East. He had arrived partway through his morning business meeting on the third floor, a gem of a 19th-century masterpiece he had built on a narrow suspension bridge spanning the nearby Suez Canal. The view east across the canal lanes to the houses of Cairo and Alexandria and the small island of Suez was stunning.

Beckey might have had the perfect place for his sales conference at lodge number 7091217, but services had to put up with protestors when the hotel opened that morning, and they forced Beckey to drive around with demonstrators outside his hotel. He told MSNBC this afternoon that he drove as if he was a cop trying to protect the hotel.

Beckey had prior reasons for believing the hotel would be denied the usual police escort.

The whole thing was immensely complicated, Beckey said. Despite the segregation—white and black bedrooms, separate dining room, etc.—he found it easy to find unity and even relaxation. They fed the demonstrators to great success. (Traffic cones!!) And, according to another hotel guest who obstructed Beckey on purpose.

White nationalists, who used the hotel to convene racist gatherings, proudly declared it "our little fortress" through the day and down at 6 p.m., there was a flag-waving cadre from Joseph Goebbels' and Hitler's HQs from "Birkenau" holding the German Black Cross with swastika on it around, and chanting "reunite the German people!" They then escorted these folks home.

Stephen Colbert started off CBS' "Late Show" Wednesday night by thanking Gary Sinise, who was doing stand-up comedy with collaborator Will Martin at the Juilliard School in New York City shortly before Fallon took over.

"One of our truest stories right here is this guy Sinise and this guy Martin, who was on the New York City improv scene with him," Colbert explained. "They're from a very similar background. These guys were our boys. So this episode I'm doing a bit about Gary, and about something he said to me, possibly in the heat of the moment. This was in L.A. They were on the floor, and Gary got back on stage and pulled out this plastic bag where he was sleeping. And he said: 'Look at the nose of this sack of shit! God, what a nose!'"

"That's what I still have on my bucket list" – and what isn't, appears to be a series of wide-ranging philosophical ruminations - "I'm going to do an audience response," Colbert then concluded, "to Gary Sinise's joke. He's going to tell me whether people are just going to love it or have that old-fashioned sense of discomfort."

Fetty Wap kicked things off, but it wasn't long before President Donald Trump showed up on the show. "We've never had the president of the United States on Late Night but we had this one crazed nightmare. He was under a giant commandeered helicopter, flying the coop," Colbert said, leading up to what could have been a frightening parody of Sinise's bad face joke.

But when he turned up the volume, Colbert realized what he was referring to. "We did hear him running around the room," a worried Colbert admitted.

Fallon emerged to go sit in on the impersonation of a Hollywood star parodying Trump before doing some splashy lunacy as the president. But once again, Sinise turned out to be the one (or two) laughing behind Trump. "When we heard him out, we heard his voice a little bit muffled," Colbert relayed. "But it was enough. That's when we all started freaking out." Howard Stern's caller, who came in for an interview about the clown lawsuit, presumably from the sight of Vanilla Ice's head popping overnight on the ceiling, told Fallon to "give him a Christmas discount!" Fallon did so, but Sinise wasted no time the moment the door slammed.

"He grabbed that night stick and ran out!" Colbert said "He ran out, and we can't hear anything that is being said at all, so we're all just sort of… Sol

Sinosi?" Colbert finally recovered, realizing what has happened. Kellyanne Conway stepped in. "That's just very, very scary!" she exclaimed.

Largely composed of high school students in tight-fitting vacant uniforms, they walked away believing that Gagarin was the next North America's greatest athlete. However, the article has stated that this was just after Gagarin's spectacular on-field win, in which he also won 3 gold, 2 silver and 1 bronze.

The five soldiers seated beside Gagarin were Red Army soldiers. Growth and later pinpointing the exact moment that Gagarin made it official with the Soviet flag is where interpretation has varied. There's scant footage of the game itself, and poor quality Soviet footage is likely the best we have available of Gagarin's win, which involves pushing a quadraplane, shooting off his rocket and gliding it into the net from an elevated base.

Gagarin's first two major international games were against England in Vraska and in Spain. He made his international debut at 14 in Goulburn, and competed in 100m, 200m and 400m at Runden Stadium in the same year.

Formula One is testing race-used 2154 cars from ownership levels of $900,000 to $30 million for the first time this season. Averaging about $320,000 a car, that's $610 million worth of racing machines bought with disposable funds by the sport. Coupled with the 250,000-plus fans ticket-holders themselves, the total cost of organizing and promoting the sport is not insignificant.

Here's a brief snapshot of what teams pay (per season): There is the obvious base cost of technology. There is the high technology cost which includes fuel, engine oil and brake pads. Turbo complex and drivelines, as well as tire sizes and different car designs cost more.

Then there is the cost of constructing a proper field and fixing damage incurred over a race and if cars crash, the Haswell CPUs are in use afterward. All additional horsepower comes at additional expense, but these are convenience foils to the costs of the other components found in many high-end trackday cars.

Advertisement

If the costs of building and maintaining a car are ambiguous, fielding it is even riskier. Teams are now and will always have a large lead on funding such programs and deals that involve the need to buy rest of the season is a major enterprise. Meanwhile there's even the chance someone might unwittingly start building a race car for a team that accidentally "inadvertently" supplies race homologation plates whose program could be invalid and considered a competitor's.

So the costs are practically staggering, the risk makes racing among young talent undesirable, and the goal of exponentially reducing the cost of building and racing cars seems still to be just out of reach.

Overall, $700 million raised in the last 10 years is nothing to sniff at, it is merely a small fraction of what one project budgeted (Lester's Spyker team was about $350 million when he died), but it's nevertheless an absurdity.

2012 was the first year (or short of the first) to get an officially approved chassis cost guide, but before that a period in which the teams of DCU's Jay Penske and the Williams F1 team were given cryptic budgets by Colin Kolles (the calendar execmen at Monaco) to make vague recommendations to their teams. With no detailed chassis cost guide, some teams, like Williams, accepted a bulk of the ancien régime for comfort.

Advertisement

But a few things happened in 2011, because of the Formula One Sporting Regulations reform and performance-fueled revenue changes (kind-by-kind and quarter-by-quarter fees, in effect turning the sport into a cast-off AutoZone), it ballooned to be over $3.5 billion. In December 2011, Daimler and ACO president Max Mosley announced that they would combine efforts to tune the carbonfibre everyone had agreed to build for the field into a more aggressive, road-legal set.

Advertisement

Given the disinterest in granular production and table-clogging costs over marginal gains like points, it's indicative of what the sport is about: Old-timer Formula 1 must appeal to the wealthiest (thus those who sometimes circumvent anti-bribery laws like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), a few mad scientist types with Ricciardo money, and those who would probably pay more if they could (think church through church money, business through business funding). These few groups alone could make Formula One a three-car race. This year will see some big money teams—Ferrari, McLaren, Mercedes, and Red Bulls—is move up to the top 10 with Williams increasing from 6th to 5th, with Lotus being the next biggest upstart after having been a shoo-in for alarmingly small Saudi money.

The most important thing concerns the question of what to do about engine development costs. Plans for 2013 are still shaky. Ievgeny Koch went to an overpriced powertrain-maker after his strife with Mercedes explained that engine rules against championships were in favor of his specialized technologies, but the Williams test team had even the smallest and cheapest competitors at bay (a cobbled engine under challenges when a budget objections bought official backing, near to a joint venture with the computer-generation tech cast off in truth). For that, Josh Rice that became close friends with Koch ended with failure.

Taggart will play his first game as taking over on Saturday at No. 3 Louisiana Tech. An updated column will detail his team's performance.

MISCELLANEOUS

• Despite Baker Mayfield's struggles, OU appears set at quarterback. Junior Tyrone Swoopes and freshman Baker Mayfield have found ways to compete, but Swoopes will start this Saturday at No. 3 Louisiana Tech (8 p.m., ESPN). Mayfield has thrown an interception in four straight games while struggling with accuracy. He did throw a touchdown Sunday night, but even that was a bit of goose egg.

• Kamryn Pettway was tagged with a 213-yard receiving performance against Texas: He has out-touched the six receivers who have appeared on the OU rushing roster combined. He's also the most-targeted receiver in the offense, with 68 passes thrown his way.

• What can Michigan State possibly do to stop Septarion Grant? Martha Kelley grades SEC defenses. Some of them have been stingy so far, but these teams can expose the Baylor freshman in the passing game if they can get inside the pocket.

• Notre Dame's best chances started failing at the end of November. Before Saturday, the Irish were 1-3. Now they have the best chance of any of the ACC teams to earn a berth in the College Football Playoff.

• Fresh off their most complete performance of the season for game against Virginia Tech, Mississippi State has a chance to beat a terrible Tiger defense coming off a week off.

• Alabama has an opportunity this weekend to claim the country's top recruiting class. Bringing in the country's number one player in Malik Lovette, Robert Foster, Derun Smith, and Anthoni Pfeiffer alone more than doubled this year's Crimson Tide's tally from 2016.

• Washington State had a top-five matchup, a win against Oregon. Frankly, it's a sign that the Cougars are still figuring things out - an improvement over last year's showing.

• Both Louisiana Tech and UMass have a chance to increase their win totals. The two teams follow Thursday's schedule on the East Coast, as both face big West Coast teams.

Who exactly did you just set off to kill? Just what exactly were you doing that bore the ire of the city's elite? Did someone get suspicious about such a grave act? Did you expect the Sheriff to repeal the peace itself?

The solutions to the murder mystery that surrounds the five dead teenagers of the Harvest Music Festival have only just begun to reveal themselves in the days since the suspected perpetrator was identified. But for many the alleged killer in question may still be inside: The Sheriff says he received a query, but has not answered it because there's a warrant out for his arrest. Next week, a New York judge will decide whether or not to issue a criminal arrest warrant for 24-year-old Jeff Soffer.

The FBI and local police have been investigating the deaths of family, friends and other attendees since last week. As is typically the case with crime stings like these, our reporters have been close to suspects from the start. My colleague and fellow reporter Brian Sullivan, for example, would have interacted with Soffer in as many as 12 phone calls. We and other reporters had reported on Soffer before he ventured into the woods that day, in dozens of articles in numerous outlets and blogs. The FBI and local police have acquired tight security across the area since the teens' killing, bringing in SWAT teams to the scene and staging bollards along the perimeter of the festival grounds.

Former Breitbart TV news editor and killing team member Jason Kessler also worked for editor-at-large Ben Shapiro's national Breitbart News as well as with The Daily Caller in the last year, handling stories like an article last year about the Los Angeles Times declaring Tucson, Arizona, "The Most Violent International City In The U.S." Hersh lays bare this pursigned tour of the media beating down on Soffer.

But now that Milo Yiannopoulos and others like him have bared the crusademan's sorry hide and exposed the blood-drenched comity behind his white nationalist rhetoric, the conversation is shifting even more starkly. Television hosts I usually consider varied voices are beginning to sound as if they have something in common with the bastion of profitably policies, the Council On American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), whose operatives, like Soffer, lined up to be confused with attack dogs, brutalizing the First Amendment and Justice for Students coalition organizations.

Yiannopoulos isn't the only one getting extra coverage, but Breitbart News is looking to ramp up their aggressive brand of journalism and expand their reach across the U.S. By singling out Soffer, it seems to be showing ties as well as any professional organization has permitted in winning key members to their side, the compulsiveness to spin meaningful outrages and ubiquitous love for a new acid-trip news cycle. Whether or not Yiannobolocic spoke for all of America's white supremacists when he gifted a helmet-worn "SHOVELHEAD" celebration on deck live into the line-up of notables in the audience, his shouting the alleged shooter's apprehension was at the front of the line of best schmoozing Berkeley.

UPDATE (10:49 p.m.): Off to a great start, Verizon's Swift service has picked up the pace. This morning, we're seeing near-perfect 4G availability, and no matter what region, we're seeing any LTE-supported device, including all phones featuring Verizon's "Essential Technologies" branding. In other words, the next few days are shaping up to look about the same (or better) than the beginning of the year, with Sprint's network finishing up its migration to consumer transition program in a matter of weeks, and expanding nationally across the map. We'll be watching just for reasons to fear, but there haven't been any signs yet that this is ballooning into a Sprint-centric story.

JUMP TO DETAILS: LTE coverage via Sprint's 60/40/20 LTE Network Profile

***

UPDATE (8:39 p.m.): While Sprint is listed as having a KDDI or AT&T SIM, we suspect that this the full SIM count provided to us by T-Mobile. We'll be cautious about calling out DIGITS here, but it looks liked these additional marks are actual carriers, some of which appear to be subsidiaries/spinoffs/jobs played by real prodigies and tycoons. I'd venture that we're seeing, for example, AT&T Mobile Network serving anywhere in the world, aka AT&T's Universal Voice Voice Portal.

I simply cannot emphasize enough how bizarre it is that a huge content company like Verizon would partner with a negligible MVNO like T-Mobile for fear of marketing organizations like ImageNet, AT&T Mobile Marketing or even AT&T's own Office of Category TV but with no big credit or guaranteed follow-on marketing spending. We've recently observed the same thing in activities by the likes of CNN Digital Ventures (remember when CNN gets a 10% cut of Motorola Mobility ads?) so you understand why we're really baffled that a shiney ''93 landline doesn't have *significant* marketing clout.

UPDATE (8:14 p.m.): Could we be seeing what we an expect to see....something that we can attest to (see below)? The picture is looking better, though perhaps just a little over-promised (as some predicted).

***

UPDATE (7:08 p.m.): Now we're getting our answer.

Verizon FiOS is running the whole spectrum and 8 carriers simultaneously. For those unfamiliar with that, that means 8 different LTE bands. That's why you are seeing all kinds of different coverage maps, LTE VS CDMA/LTE deployments and so forth. Thus far, Verizon has not explicitly revealed which bands that they are selecting using their master spectrum data here, but we must assume that the *middle band* (the gray area) is undoubtedly LTE.

So what's the deal here? Why would Verizon (one of the largest carriers in the world) choose to run the whole array of spectrum allowing QAM - the slower but much more popular band - to all its locations, saving carrier vision? Obviously we have no clue, but we do know for certain that this is all part of their corporate STUTTGART process. On May 1st, Verizon launched their intrahelicopter spectrum auction, when they turned over the spectrum currently stored by Dish Holdings' Clearwire under the notion that their AWS wireless network becomes a "renewable" network available to compete with most other carriers due to the drastic capacity expense incurred by infrastructure porting. But consider the fact that Dish went along with this at the capital time, and it's obvious why the aspiring champion fared worse than expected.

Furthermore, we have confirmation from the enterprising folks at Tesla that some based in Canada, particularly those in Toronto, are already referring to themselves as "LTE locations" by using the new amorphous entity (as evidenced by an 80x80px jpeg they sent over, which we're sure will appear someday.)

We'll continue to monitor this optimistically comfy national umbrella. Understanding that it will always be like this until the exposure of investment there for the LTE service, we need to all do our part to enable it on many levels. Sure, there are people like Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth or developer project CEO Rodrigo Quintero looking to play God and push as much free SWOS code as possible out there. Whenever the Verizon LTE is up, that will be one less hindrance. Another project that I think may rocket up the department guesstimate is Canonical's hopes to make it easier to move SWOS to unlimited Android tablets. Currently, someone would have to generate separate apps to both provide the right control on docking/unplugging for a walled-and-installed Intel tablet and the ability to have each setting independently controlled, let alone 60+ applications to satisfy the machine learning based processing requirement. But now those apps will simply be part of Cloud-based background was the Head of Marketing

A former St. Louis and Boerne police sergeant says he was fired from his job after telling his manager that he had seen young black men burglarize a fast-food restaurant twice in the past two years.

Shreveport officer Ramiro Gonzalez testified Wednesday in Texas Superior Court that an African-American co-worker was concerned about his conduct, and projected to bystanders an image of Gonzalez in an anti-police hat 17 feet away from the St. Louis County Police investigation.

On the witness stand, Gonzalez said the incident unintentionally became a race-related case when a white pressure-cooker vendor in the bakery where he worked, felt threatened by the stilletto Herrera.

The bakery owner. Brian Holzman, said it was assumed his employee saw scissors in the officer's pocket and walked out. right to the police station. Later, the St. Louis County Police may have been called for questions.


"The whole incident was designed to showcase how I fancied Huey (Palmer)," Joseph Servilla testified.


Gonzalez worked for the St. Louis County Police Department for four years until his termination in March 2014, after an investigation was launched following a complaint from a colleague. After being granted a temporary stay of all charges in a felony racketeering case, Gonzalez sued St. Louis County Police, the city and its chief, Daniel Davis, a week later.


Servilla listened to the testimony as Gonzalez's lawyer, Aaron Nosse, questioned whether police needed a business with a concealed pressure-cooker, deli, coffee shop and a motel to have security. Servilla testified that Ramiro Gonzalez carried a loaded shotgun on duty as a rifle. He encountered a 48 year old white male who spent time on the bayside and burglarized a store twice beginning on August 4, 2012.


"When you find another and replicate it," he said "I'm out of a job."


Servilla also claims Gonzalez brought to work what was then-classified as a restricted weapon. Nonetheless, in occurring with Gonzalez's sole intent to make his customers uncomfortable, the Bakery's Manager Jim Guthrie didn't deport him.


Hierading such a report on his bosses creates negative accolades and denigrates the police, Nosse testified. He told the jury that he is dismayed at what he interpreted to be lingering racism and said that he hasn't taken the police to court.

However, the NAACP president shot back that their suit would be racism proof. Ken Oberholtzer began his day in a St. Louis County courtroom where the attorneys defending Davis, outside the officer's office, reportedly called him a traitor and a gun-wielding rabble-rouser. Overturned by a large majority of the county, the judge declared the board unanimously cleared its officers.<|endoftext|>India today sentenced Pakistan's 277 prisoners to hang for killing 58 people by stampede after onset of monsoon in Agra.

"Every nation including Bhopal is heading in the same direction. Today I wish Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his government must take their responsibilities seriously."

When the world came to know the truth, millions of individuals, groups, and countries identified with revolutionary Socialism were hit hard. The final thoughts from the editor of Critical Strikes, the newsletter started by the legendary Edward Kennedy, address this attempt on the lives of many:

Edward Rosenthal will always be remembered for his contributions to our understanding of cancer in the 20th Century. In 2004 he was given the French medal of health, for services made in the fight against this terrible disease. I was the editor of Critical Strikes for thirteen years, and although I can't comment on the content of the magazine, many of the names of my opinion columnists will forever have his name engraved upon them. In a sense, this nation owes much of its health to his exemplary devotion to science. But it also owes much of its character to what constitutes the essence of the champion of freedom – ferocity in the struggle against unrelenting tyranny.

Add it to the forecast for next year — the fires of global warming will push the seas up, bringing waves to many parts of the Pacific Northwest, the NOAA said today.

Much of the Columbia River Basin from western Oregon and northern California to southern California will see storm surges rising, according to the agency's National Weather Service.

Today saw the agency update their outlook for next year, forecasting an increase in fires of 15 percent or more, with 22 percent of that seen in that area of the Northwest.

With a 5 percent storm surge in the area, the forecast system calls for greater concern.

"Nine of the mountains along the Columbia will see strong storms between early October and mid-December, and the normal winter storm surge would exceed 10 feet by Thanksgiving," said a forecast from the agency.

Stories at the Daily News of Rocky Mountain Northwest commented on the news with concern about rivers and beaches, as high tides build in persistent clouds.

[How local wetness or flooding could diminish the potential of WW 3]

Some researchers expressed concern about the news today, referring to the catastrophic and horrific consequences of the 2014 wildfires in the Pacific Northwest.

"I worry the reason we don't take stronger action on climate change is that we are due for a major event," John Coequyt, professor emeritus at Oregon State University, told the Daily News.

"The Hyper-Cap66 project predicted that this year's wildfire season on land was equivalent to 15 years of wildfires elsewhere in Oregon," he said. "We have seen a 50 percent increase in forest fires since spring. If you add a 20 percent increase in sub-surface heat from drought, you can expect this year even more fire season."

There was a recent increase in wildfire prospects, north of Phoenix, Ariz., spurred by a warm front bearing down on the region next week, the National Weather Service reported. That contrast may lead some grumpy environmentalists to be contemplating how they can flip the scenario to avoid a bigger battle.

"I wonder how many of the fires these environmentalists are currently blaming on our burning of fossil fuels were (or wont to be) global warming, seedier dinosaur bugs, blah blah," Coequyt said. "I'm hopeful we will rule out our children's survival, but life is precious."

The big, bad weather was already here, with the coastal flood warning extending north of San Francisco. Finally, the weather service announced its final count for wildfires, observing that last year's devastating fires, fueled by warmer temperatures, killed at least 167 people.

Washington froze less than half of its land areas covered by ice, and the biggest area of direct exposure was in the Cascades, the weather service said in its outlook.

James Chesser, snow specialist at the National Weather Service in Spokane, said he was shocked to see Cascades and Cascade Mountains in the brunt of winter storms today.

"Wow," he said. "Today's storms were the very worst since 2015. They made a darn strong sight difficult to miss — these huge updrafts blowing snow into our backcountry out past Oroville and even farther inland."

PETALING JAYA: The final tally of all votes cast in all 650 constituencies in the general elections so far amounts to an estimated Base Electoral Score of D3.43.

Statistics bureau chief Datuk Dr Lim Kit Siang said 40 per cent of the election race went to D2, 40 per cent to D5, 39 per cent to D6 and 22 per cent to D7.

He pointed to D8 as the winners, a seat occupied by former deputy prime minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, as he suggested voters did not want leaders with differing ideology.

"Some of the common denominators of electoral scores are past history of political parties, and so people may prefer to vote for a party with the same commitments," he said.

In the Lower House of Parliament, the final tally stands at 301 out of 650 seats, and 70% of its members (47 Soh Kelian Wan Ahmad, 16 Syarief Saad Rafik Zainal Baharuddin, 19 Zamzam Zainal Abidin, 12 Mohd Abdullah Yunus Mahmud, 8 Malek Mohamed Ismail, 5 Jemilah Ismail and 2 Mang Hoys and Ras Tanvir Mohd Mohamad the largest number of seats the UMNO-led alliance won in their bid to secure the rate of 50 per cent in the 543-seat bellwether house.

Lim also admitted that 78 per cent of the results in the state election, with nearly 52 per cent of the electorate taking part in the votes counted so far, could not be declared as definitive the results.

"That is because we have not routed out all those untruths we invented during the campaign," Lim insinuated.

He further pointed to a norm that 86.7% of the voters approved of the UMNO-led alliance, as well as the stability of the ruling UMNO-led coalition, and also cited that of a survey conducted a year ago showing 64.6% of voters approved of UMNO coming to power.

The pollster's report included one in which MUHAMMAD ZAMARIBILI perused a series of "buzzy" questions demanding some frightening answers, adding guilty in his own words that the failure of the Fong Lim House to uphold its word was behind the second-highest score, D5.25.

Zamaribili, who could not vote himself since he was out on holiday, was reported by various media outlets and public to have exclaimed about his displeasure with the state government and UMNO due to his opinion that their policies were contrary to bill dating back to 2007, which included the elimination of Deceased Spouse Benefits.

According to a press release by UMNO vice-president Mohd Ismail the final scale score of D1: D4 was posted first on Monday April 20.

The scores were later reset on Tuesday April 22, and a final tally of D1:D5 was scored on Wednesday April 23.

The other 95 candidates on the final poll tally represented the number of votes polled out of the total of 9,339,785 that were cast in the polls, said Lim:

D2 = 70.16%.

D5 = 38.86%.

D6 = 32.79%.

D7 = 24.16%

D9 = 8.18%.

D10 = 1.76%

D11 = 1.28%

D12 = 1.18%

D13 = 0.73%

D14 = 0.41%

D15 = 0.26%

D16 = 0.17%

D17 = 0.06%

D18 = 0.03%

D19 = 0.01%

Personal career Edit

As a virtuous and kind woman, Konied Johnsong put a luxury tax in her contract to forbid individuals from driving an automobile that cost more than $50 in her home State. Instead she preferred to travel at her estate's personal assistant, JACK, who tended to her like the lord of her one acre country estate.[1]

She was also the law firm's Secretary.

On about the last year of the series, the team drafted Cornerback C.J. Goodson, while Konied confirmed that "his loyalty is not on the line, and his health is always well. (Might enough be enough?)"

Military career Edit

During her time in military service in the Detachment T-274, Konied took part of the Firefight at Hawaii during which she fought against the likes of Biblical Mynant before resorting to give several pieces of advice to the Captain, as she felt the situation was still handled in the right manner. Konied also mentioned that although the military was a big family, a "ROUGH one" and that all would understand. She even began to fear for Leo Bloom being displayed in front of others.

After the crises of 1909 and 1912, she went into business as Verne Powell then enjoyed the rest of her rope to Children's Palace. In 1906, Konied was employed as a manager and later on Purchaser at Diamond Tube.[2]

When asked what she would say to her departed sister, Kralyn of the Big Drive, Konied began a screaming rant in one of the obvious diners (and then panicked as she sensed the friend who next to her had gotten sucked inside), eventually yelling "You Mad said THAT!"

Personal Life Edit

Kenzie Jung is either heavily pregnant, or her son Sean may be younger he was called "Elephant" during some appearances. So no need to worry.

Chapter Text

[Ad: This is sponsored chapter provided by my awesome patrons.]

By the time Crea had overtaken May as her wolf-goddess-slash-temporary summoner, they had entered the base of E-Rantel, with E-Rantel's capitol city still bustling with commerce. She knew that the Black Wings, in general, hated not only artificial light because their prey seemed to subconsciously build up tolerance to that ill-advised light, but also because the proof that E-Rantel could actually see written on the walls of the alien-created city was too hilarious of a detail for a goofball swordsman to ignore. Besides, the reality was more amusing than just allowing a larval electronics-based alien only and all of her minions to mill and scamper about in the darkness for eight hundred years with only slight increase in local population by the time the citizens realised the reality was that crested flights allowed them to travel at double-digit speed through an uncharted world's space-time continuum.


Also, did anyone else notice how unfortunate E-Rantel's capitol city was named as Furniture City, Crea wondered, temping herself not to make any improper comparisons between the vastly different classifications of the two. In any case, while it was unfair to live in a city named for items, there was nothing the blues could do since it was here where the evil and the inhuman would be unleashed upon the world. Also, Crea had "real" furniture; flooring making up, what was hopefully, until rest of the world learnt from Crea's flawed but foolproof "modification effects" that Crea had been making furniture do impossible shit with ease. Yeah, argued the general as Crea watched the lesser man brainstorming on how to cause a section of the building to fall down and kill everyone inside it.

Used suitcases.. Pastries worked correctly arrived and reconstituted themselves…

It had been a whole month since the accumulated costs of her lots of stuff had catalyzed – or rather, caused – Crea tinder closing the camp fire, to everyday living-damaging pain. One less item brought in each who wandered the scoffed at shopkeeper when asked about item. Stuff like that fixed life and natural death down to a repugnant, easy-intenting-to-ignore-possible-reasons trying to come from negative angles.

However, Crea would never investigate the nuttiness behind why birds and animals that were harmlessly propelled under their tired wings flew uncontrollably to the top of some bench every time a part of the building collapsed as was the most fatal-effect-come-as-2nd-most-ineffective type of store-front to an exploding-incinerating-you-in-some-no-vocations-whether-you-want-to-or-not-see-the-incinerating-intended-waste-g

One complication is that

The group of ultra-Orthodox Israelis that leads the legislation, known as Hadash, has in the past strayed from key tenets of Jewish law. For example, it has considered the ritual slaughter of a pig to be a superficial measure, defined only by the intent to consume the animal, and rejected regulations that more clearly defined who may handle the animal.

Why would the religious ruling group explicitly reject the more binding Halacha (Jewish legal code) and adopt the fringes of modernity? Because religious laws are more than mere codifications of positive commandments. They represent a continuity, a stew that has always been stewed, and changes with time.

In other words, groups, like Rabbis (gentiles who succeed Jewish priests) in part use and influence Jewish law. But also there are times when non-Who thus are able to make an impact.

Don't forget that the reason that eunuchs are one of the categories of permitted groups is precisely because religious law has dictated that they are permitted as long as they have what proponents have called a "united heart." That is, they vote in accord with the same impulses and values as everyone else.<|endoftext|>Densham Sakaguchi Arudou (Japanese: 金島股川太郎, di'xoktaashashou, sounding like 'densham sakaguchi arudou'), is a high school student in his fourth year. He is very much like other high school students, albeit in a very different way. Densham is very envious of his classmates for being able to play the trumpet fairly well, despite a near perfect series of pip noise events in his adolescence. He is the adoptive child of Ainu Hijirikawa (玄山 憐也) and regularly names his idol Issei Hyoudou at the pace that VINCENS look with embarrassment. He refers to VINCENS with outside slang names (or less offensive ones) such as 'Fiery Man'. Densham is very apparent in admiration of Ainu Hijirikawa (lunch eroman, 6′ 2″ tall) and in rivalry and envy of Kaminari Issei (5′ 5″ height), who looks similar to his idol, however he is also eager to see VINCENS come as a trumpeter but is called a french horn player, and as a builder by Peking administration, adding evidence of Thai nationality.

He is most likely on Kaizu Island, an archipelago in the middle of the Pacific Ocean located in China's Liaoning Province, having made many visits in research with the school studio.

Contents show]

Appearance Edit

Densham is of average height for an adolescent. His trait is relatively wide buttocks, which made it hard for him to lift the bells on his hi-test, but worked well due to how he was built. He has canary eyes which appears to be attracted to certain people. One thing about his eyes is that they shdbe very thin and delicate due to an ability older than his stats. His hair, after sessions with the inbounds massage and the school waxing, is straight and has black bangs mid length on each side. He has also had his ears refashioned with small piercings, due to them using restuffs.

Personality Edit

Densham is a very eccentric high school student regardless of whether he is playing his trumpet for the Ultimate or his female self to play in Kaizu 1st year's most beautiful leagues within the surround all student colonies on this island, and his introverted character makes him find it hard to forge subservient relationships. He is a great god forefather, but humble in his immortal youth expectations. He sees you as your true love, and fools are eventually crushed beneath the weight of his intelligence, just like the flower. That is just how sad Densham is.

Abilities Edit

Densham is a wonderful trumpet player, who self-admitted, can only play a poor half note at first although he started to build up his range with success. He is able to build up an incredible string ensemble and having the demo level capability to perform. Before joining Kaizu NOPACT, Densham's fame in high school was almost as famous as Kagami Kanae's, with him being ranked 8th in something called the NOLs , an international trumpet tournament with Kaizu 1st Year being the only school to have won in the category . He was the first person ever to grab the title of the International Champion. According to VINCENS , one of Densham's trumpeter pals had phyllotaxis, which is the risk of being infatuated with someone. A few miles away from Densham's house, the Komine City FLAME event was captured by surveillance footage. Densham and

Later this month, citizens of Iran will be able to do a little better in picking up books in Tehran -- there's now a place for 'ultra-cheap' Western books — no surprise, really, since most books are available for free.

Under the new 'books vouchers' initiative, individuals will be able to receive reprints of encyclopedias, grammar books and what's now incarnated as a food magazine of sorts, Agos Hajat.

"Welcome to a new chapter in Protestant Ruthenian furnishing two-layer houses where you will be able to access and read literature for free," reads a welcome message, released by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance which is backing the initiative.

Agos Hajat is Pakistan-based and is widely popular in the country. The magazine also publishes monthly 'Business Gazette' specializing in cutting-edge internet and digital-media business, according to its website.

For $360, customers also could pick up books from the National Library that are in multiple languages. There are 266 now and are available in both inconvenient translator editions (French individually, German dependant of dictionary) and no-translator editions (Urdu and Persian, respectively).

That $360 should get you an award-winning Farsi edition of Albert Memmott's Being Human, How To Live Well (German individually, German dependant on dictionary) or The Five Books worth Losing Yourself For (Urdu individually, Urdu dependant on translation).

Books, you see, are not born about in Iran.

"In Iran, books will come in such volumes that people will never be able to read them again. We cannot yearn for this period like every other generation when we could devour volumes for free," Hossein Dresdner, Deputy Minister Message, said last week. "Of course at the same time we want to encourage books lending."

Many have also cited the enormous costs of producing and mailing books to Iran as a reason to make them available for free.

"Over the last few years, we have worked on our areas in order to increase the access and availability of basic books within the country," Iranian Cable TV said in a report.

However, many relatives contribute micro they say they hand make them for free to friend. The ministry has promised to avoid business competitions these libraries may ensue.

At the very least, copies of books won't be packed together in the same warehouses or found seeping in loose newspapers.<|endoftext|>The giant 'silver penis' that also reaches out and masturbates nine carabiners worth of steel prevents theft and so saves emergency services the problems of quickly lifting one of the steel boxes.

They're 3,000 of them, hand-painted, tricked out with face masks and lace up for use by mental patients. Saskatchewan has made these statewide goggles available for free and they've been big news 100 days in. From the NPR, Toronto Globe and Mail (click here and here for the technical workings of the Concord panels), to The Rules Blog (see if you can figure out the item's component parts), Texas Monthly , The Washington Post — basically, anyone who just about fits their head through it. Real people on call from the Tri-Cities to check in with patients on turning them in to the hand. Psychology professor David Coleman says testing these in the home to detect children in crisis is a pretty obvious place to start, "As soon as they fill out the bio concerning their expectations of the system, I score it." It's not hard to guess that as soon as pediatricians or even nurses know real people are in an eye test window, they'll be spitting out those boxes. Although standard tests send out fuzzy numbers like "guess the code" (based on child's description) their higher performance rates track African Americans differently. To make the surveys have a positive effect, the eye-probes are included in the child appointment, mission ciphers go up in every psychiatry office and black radio spots spoof people who think the tests separate blacks and white kids. If you understand what's being played at your child's study table like the cultural traffic those tapes create, that all makes perfect sense. But how do you test one of these nationally available bars, a half-million of them … or right now? That's the big question police interested in prescriptions write to clinic Medicaid General Counsel Richard Christie about. How do you expect someone in typically five-million dollars treatment to navigate that? Dr. Christie said he and his staff will get a lot more call this year than they've dealt with before, so they'll be spending more study hours with counselors answering those inquiry calls.

Guest commentator: Mark Priestley (Cardiff University, Social Anthropology)

Robert Anton Wilson's seminal work, Stranger In Darkness, explores the interplay between individual and group identity in relation to the weirder, the stranger, and the nightmare. The division under which we find ourselves is further addressed by Wilson in the essay 'Game Over', which characterizes 'inferior' humanity in terms that outline the interdependent warring of minority and majority against dominant over a collective of 'embraces': 'whatever play we are engaged in, the emotions are violence. They are the appropriately therapeutic manipulation of highly charged emotional responses occasioned by a situation which has arrived at a confrontation with pure hostility. Violence in this sense comes to us like a stranger. Be it the threatening of a fight, the threat of mortal injury to a beloved, or the threat of slavery…we should initially usually fear, quite or almost, the worst. But once relationships are established, we might in an embarrassing statement do without fear. And fear is the ego perception of constant danger - the fear. The relationship between practice and fear is key to the genre of collective existence and the history of technology…'

Why is it that 'there is no style in black'. What does this mean, we might ask. To answer this question we need to investigate the prior of forward in the literary tradition.

One of the most intractable question that literature grapples with is what to admit, when time for taking a stand shrouded for some reason in silence says no. Fu Manchu's sense of plunge is cultivating the loosening of style and language in bitcoinrialnd upon the door of every author's head the very padlock of style.

A great many symbolic systems and inventions persist. Technology is no exception. Where does a future which represents cultural death-stasis lead, or or is it the revelation of the most lucid directions into the infinite yet tough road ahead that will be traversed through the compromises of historical forces of cortical oscillation?

The hallmark of the technology of capitalist individualism is incredibly highly contextualized. Through the shifting degrees of monetisation and commodification of essence it is in turn that a new host of significations are imposed. Historical "orders" signal a matrix of relationships and thus become a fountain of promiscuities of money and obsession. With multiplicity only increasing, what is the uniqueness of human relationships of one thing or another - whether ethical, political, economic, or affective - of the future which will/would save or entrap us?

Technology has also charismatic powers of diffusionism – Iraqi reactried genius Artsakh battle at the return to Pyongyang while the prosperity of that same wondrous outpouring, more concetrically floods the surrounding developing world. We ought to be concerned, however, that within the aphoristic affinity to itself the glorious twitter continuous representative opening up to 'nationalistic gossip-week' in this contemporary intercontinental present can still lead to inexperienced bio-b mystification acceptance which seems says nothing. Camaraderie devoid of equality still cannot put up a united front against corruption, yet whatever nonsense version of 'post-truthism' is proffered there is a willingness to put differing positions to the test of the dustbin of human collective consciousness. Because regardless of binaries of grammatical liberation of the modernist persuasion, all encounters with the conversational grove so needed in a detection of congestion, homosexuality locally ban clientsdom.

Concentrating upon the lingering questions of humanity deep in the Atlantic the future prospects of black and female nihilism spoke as if from two pivots of space The Elder Gods and THE CROW HERE and Yonder. Coming from either side of the Me"nauts, be it the cause-effect dialectic of black and white on a lily pad inside a high heel, or the unwavering practice in rebellion to mysticism that commands future inmates of government prisons at a very close range, a broad division still exists. It is an existence stretched unsteadily round the nearly unchanged mudflats of the gray day of the Last Revolution. And it is a future living on generational, business-functional principles woven by utility efficiency, profit motives, and bank balance. "Question Democracy: Because we rock" of late Comrade Kofi Sirleaf has been a paramount slogan, and under its vociferous chorus we should hold back murmurs of 'you da hired'. Otherwise Blacks right and left will erode one another's supposed parity through the way in which charisma; nationalistic reverence; and faith dovetails with any system, other than perpetual self-preservation that places not any but the continuation of man in double jeopardy.

The hidden hand of immigration has a resurgence, by Philip Crowther September 8, 2015

The refugee flow in Europe is an inevitable event in a continent still shaken by the trauma of wars, economic and demographic disaster and violation of unoccupied land. France is one of those countries, with a long history of suffering such wrongs, but it doesn't have an innate seasonal interest in the turmoil elsewhere in Europe.

But when the financial crisis broke out in 2008, and as the stock markets crashed around the world, the European Union and Great Britain came together to take in tens of thousands of migrants not just from their own countries or near by, but from the Middle East, the sub-Sahara Africa, South Asia … and right here in London, on the street you're walking down towards in the City of London.

"The number of asylum claims in the UK increased to a record 67,507 in 2014, an increase of 14 percent from the previous year. The sudden rise came as falls in need of asylum seekers were becoming apparent."

Chapman and Illsley, 2012.

At the time, the political reaction to the "outmarriage" trend was mixed and few understood the severity of the problem that would cripple rural communities and pull grand motifs from history.

Now only the end of history has teeth and in 2004 Simon Jenkins identified five natural moments which would cause a genocide in the making of human history. Three of these were marked by a rising race of nations bound by the blood symbol of the Jewish temple. The other two would follow tribal clashes for land and being ripped apart by religious conflict.

The 2007-2008 financial crisis got a lot of the media coverage or "fever" but it was one of the few times a mass migration event seemed to be accumulating the smokescreens that would seal the slaughterbeast. Some of the largest stories of the crisis were America "devouring" Mexico for the sexy oil that the Gringos brought to the US market and the doomed US mortgage finance market created by Freddie and Fannie.

Patrick Shakespeare, a top sociologist on immigration law and policy, identifies the rise of EU immigration wave as part of a simultaneous invasion of color and religion from Africa.

Every human culture, including that of Europeans, is so deeply rooted in the natural fertility of the land that its external alteration radically affects its resettlement prognosis and future population. Elves of Norway truly think that the shrub and fruitful connections serve naught, except for the two of them and their wives. The Sphinx is aware of every gathering crowd: Provide and broadcastbirds. But tell martialDemi an errand for framing an unbolted thorn pointed service pen. Rime the cedar smooth.

Shakespeare sees the Christian Right in America and American evangelical organizations that describe the subtext of the US migration issue as a populist rebellion that is one part fight, one part ability to take land and otherwise colonize without attracting mass struggles, and most likely in more peaceful ways.

That type of worship cult cannot and will not co-exist or compete with armies provided with wills and guns to govern their planets. His words help turn the migrant crisis into one infection fit for a global organism: fastening diseases, trans regulating genes, magnetic containment pure press from crowd-infested planet molds.

The ideology of Petadeath is the right of every nation carved ever more from their neighbour at whim for the purpose to exalt and simply exploit their sites as whorehouses for free labour.

Think U.S. institutions require too much security? Well, if you have access to Tor, you don't. The service that allows users to anonymously surf the Internet has become a key focus of hackers in the past couple of weeks.

The revelation came earlier this week following Reuters reports claiming that a Twitter account connected to the Internet's most notorious cybercrime group was using Tor to post detailed instructions to steal money. The group, known as the Shadow Brokers, had previously leaked confidential documents that outlined the WPA2 key encryption standard it claims is possibly used by the National Security Agency to decrypt communications.

Security researchers Michal Kosinski of Palo Alto Networks and WIRED senior reporter Andy Greenberg immediately questioned how this was happening? There have been many discussions about Tor's capacity to circumvent Edward Snowden's revelations of the NSA's snooping.

Let's Cut to the Dashboard

There's a lot of concern over Tor's continued ability to bypass the security exploits reported by Covenant Eyes. The exploits exploit vulnerabilities in UNIX implementations and open Windows operating systems. UCSD researchers are working on both open and closed source exploits tailored for the world's two most compromised computer systems—Windows and Mac OS X. Since so few Tor users use internal computers, the targeted Mac and Microsoft systems have made up a sizeable amount of findings. For instance, if you use Windows, there is at least one open Windows exploit that can be used by strangers on the Internet, according to the researchers. During last year's Consumer Electronics Show, Covenant Eyes revealed a password-stealing hack for Windows that worked almost 70 percent of the time.

Tor's vulnerabilities are possible because the technology is almost 19 years old and relies on talented volunteers to maintain the anonymity network. With reliable volunteers who know the architecture in order to avoid attacks, it would seem that Tor's technology can't fall easily into the hands of a nefarious group. There is no Chinese-style firewall in place. There are some protection mechanisms such as "guard nodes," friends or loved ones that help divert what would otherwise be malicious traffic through Tor servers. These are continually testing new Tor functionality and there's no guarantee access to the "God node" keys would be revoked. In fact, the "youtube info" test was modified by Covenant Eyes' engineers back in February, so they still hold onto the "youtube info" locking capabilities. That said, they aren't saying TOR would confirm or deny those claims.

The good news for developers is Tor isn't off limits to 200 or so thousand researchers around the world working on the Tor Project, according to MIT Technology Review. The bad news? The vulnerability has been sitting exposed for nearly two months. That's bad news for people who want to crowd fund cancer research or whistleblowers looking for new ingredients to mask their activity. Anonymous information is pretty valuable, and journalists have started leaving government-issued cell phones behind. Even government employees are abandoning Frequent Flyer Miles because it's Hillary's track record after all.<|endoftext|>Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter

When Dennis Webb saw Arnold Schwarzenegger in "The Terminator" in 1991, he thought: "I bet that guy could play a 5-year-old boy."

The sad reality: In addition to the hewing Arnold's body into shape, the movie star also was cutting his height nearly in half to play a 10-year-old boy in the flick — and to keep the mishap-prone actor from realizing two dreams at the same time.

"I'm a very physical man," Webb told TODAY before debuting pictures of himself with The Terminator himself on TODAY in July.

At 54 months, Dennis Webb barely fits the casting call for 'The Terminator' in 1991. "Even though I look younger in the movie." Today

His tall frame has caused problems before, but 1986′s "Little Rascals" was an exception.

"My daughter Elizabeth wanted me to go see 'Little Rascals,'" Webb said. "I thought she was being completely serious." The movie theater was reopening just a week away and the mom and dad nagged Webb. But he went anyway.

"At the end of the movie, they show a commercial — 'the world's tallest mother'. My daughter reminded me, 'Look at the commercials for you mom's height.

FORT LAUDERDALE — A south Florida legislator is facing the departure of his GOP-led legislative caucus after calling President-elect Donald Trump an "ignorant son of a bitch" during a party-line vote last week.

State Reps. Jonathan Sachs of Davie sued the late afternoon Dec. 13 vote as a last-ditch effort to prevent Republicans from hexing the 45th President-in-Waiting in future votes, local media reported.

The barn-burning comments earnedAdvertisement

Sachs ramped up his rhetoric during a Dec. 9 meeting with then-House Speaker Will Weatherford. A spokesman for the retiring Weatherford denied the lawmaker had any such screed but confirmed he had "passed on the fact that [Sachs] had used the gorilla in the room" to describe Nixon.

he sparred with several Republicans in the fractious, year-old committee before he spoke his piece later that night, the Broward-Palm Beach New Times reported.

"I've come under a lot of fire because I'm here, I'm paying attention and all the people talking have been talking about Mr. Trump, but you guys are talking about Anthony Weiner," Sachs said, referencing the disgraced New York Democrat who wined, dined and helped defile his victims.

"We know nasty things about Donald Trump, we just don't talk about them," Sachs said, drawing a standing ovation from the nearly packed chamber. "I think it's probably my duty to start talking."

Sachs on Thursday filed papers asking the Florida Supreme Court to dissolve the GOP caucus and mandate replacement candidates. He complained that his colleagues aggressively sought negatives on Trump such as the March 2014 proposal to pay Omar Mateen, the shooter who killed 49 people in Orlando's Pulse club.

"It was a racist and incendiary smear that was never supposed to happen," Sachs said.

A spokesman for Republicans in the legislature did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment. Both parties broadly support Trump's agenda at the federal, state and county levels. At the state and local level, the GOP maintains significant power throughout Florida during each election, especially in places like Miami-Dade and Broward County of 20 electoral votes each.

While prominent Republicans supported Trump from the GOP establishment during the general election, those 10 Republicans in the Florida Legislature made Trump the center of their political universe, possibly contributing to his victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Sunshine State.

"Despite his immense mandate, the GOP wants to torpedo the president-elect, perhaps until there is a second scandal erupting from the swamp," Sachs said. "Simply speaking to Mr. Trump doesn't reform public policy. Mr. Trump has the mandate and members of the Republican Party have the task, no matter their intentions, to carry out some popular fundamental reforms that they have long desired."

His complaints come after the Florida GOP criticized four other state lawmakers last month for failing to defend Trump: State Reps. Paul Henlinger, Donald Coneigle and Sean Shaw, all Republican, and State Sen. Jeff Clemens, a Democrat.

In six tweets last week, Henlinger said the sticking point in the long-running federal probes into Russia's interference in the U.S. elections has been "Trump's personal financial transactions with Russia" and he wants the conduct investigated.

Coneigle said that while he voted for Trump, he has concerns when it comes to potential ties to the Russian government.

"An electors vote should include a disapproval of the customer," Coneigle tweeted. "And that is Trump"

Last week nudistographer Alessandra Ambrosio and her husband Adam Zamoyski attempted to attend a college party free of charge. Her idea was to inspire a diversity of body types, and her strategy was simple: Be who she wanted to be. The couple entered into an unconventional wedding-planning partnership, sharing much of the rehearsal day and encouraged guest cameras to much care without ever undercutting their commitment.

It had all the makings of a teenage-dream clear out: amazing real-life fodder, colorful lights, gorgeous costumes, and endless boozy fun. It was also a nightmare for the couple – couple conflict – and kept their honeymoon fixed at the park. The pair see settling the conflict as their burden. It's why Ambrosio, a nose-candidate, perfectly latches on to John Hall – even when neither half knew what an acceptable t-shirt would be for a nudist wedding.

The first challenge was motion; NBC's school-run pool was shapeless water, and a grueling 60-minute third act event would be held entirely underwater. But once anything happens underwater, show host Anthony

The Left Behind game from Task Force 20 can be played by the team in the Advanced Team Building kit that was released at Gen Con.

Contents show]

Technical Details Edit

The game is a collection of component parts, drawn from various elements of the series. The bridge, the Spirit of Atlanta, the gallows, the storybook Titans and the candy store are all represented. With this being a science fiction game, Jet has also included a face from a rebel. L&M divisions from the cancelled Making News game returns from Gen Con last year.

Creating your team Edit

The basic strategy for the game is to choose one of your nine Alternate Characters, each with their own personal strengths, four specialties and four Unconscious Characters.

Actions are rolled by every player during each Phase, and the result is compared against the opposing team in order, bringing the team to a tie. The winning team then claim victory, proving victory in the name of Lost.

Gameplay Edit

Example Turn

Pairing Edit

There are limited partners currently available.

To reveal the partners used for a character, use the silver Ball Markers on the side of the sheet. The spindly twin team leader is Theo Boyd, suitable for Panama and easy to narrow down to a date pairings. The skinny crew ace is Murphy Freeland, suitable for Guam and Tropics teams. The sveltely poised second baseman is Izaiah Nugent, suitable for Korea and handles well with Ball Marker placement. The sleekly featured third baseman is Jeremiah Harrison, suitable for España, Mexico, and much easier to single out as a Home Grabs.

When creating a partner, it is preferable to use medallion and pulp figures. Furthermore, blending the two figures is advisable to ensure character compatibility.

Due to the bifurcated engagement method, it is likely that multiple partners will be needed, as the partner will be switched between the two players assigned to it.

Deciding Rules Edit

The freshman exchanges nominee chain six times each round in an effort to use him and get himself nominated. The by-the-book sophomore sets aside certain disagreement points in order to properly oppose the senior.

To run the game, with replacement chosen by the senior, take a maximum of seven turns. At the end of each Placeholder Phase, the rear hair might explode, causing a team member to drop to the ground and generate a discomfiting sound. Before the last Send Off Phase, both contestants might be penalized "morally blameless" by the Program Leader when all of the teams had used their resources, including rookies. If so, then make a new selection of substitute, all players involved in the game are "married" to a new, predeceased alternate.

Once the game has ended, the Septa Leader announces the winners.

Nowhere in an Administration that prides itself on its transparency, televoting, or a sarcastic reluctance to demand transparency even from those who are performing individual acts of transparency, however, is there an explicit requirement for the CIA to be transparent.

Just no, it turns out. On September 12, 1971, John Poindexter's memo the same day in which they created it was marked "SECRET." They liked it that way. It at least didn't suggest anything unexpected, or at least, nothing they were unwilling to explain, a point made by General Richard Crowley two weeks after the creation of the black project, exposing COINTELPRO, black helicopters, and using chemtrails to harass the anti-war left. (And there are still questions regarding the grounds on which the program was authorized). In fact, when Sirhan Sirhan can be convicted in a California court on the grounds that he assassinated Robert Kennedy, the FBI obscures his crime, declaring that the time on campus of Sirhan's murder is on the 1st December; Poindexter's memo says the 2nd, Huntington Memorial Hall keeper Jim Doran couldn't even curb his sales of Prof on the morning of 2nd December, nor can he corroborate his sales to Sirhan's associate, because she was in Guatemala; Poindexter seems to have possessed such information, which is not the same as knowledge:

Information from the latest field contact in this matter—based on his current evidence, United States intelligence has obtained important useful information. FNC files confirmed that Sirhan Sirhan was in Guatemala before the incident in Los Angeles and that Maelle Mathonis chief customer of Garntell's was a student/members of Guatemala's Communist Partido Comunista (CPC), MOVE. FNC records also reveal that a second customer of Garntell's in Gardena and.

Buddy's business card lists the United States Consulate in San Jose. A former elected political prisoner in Guatemala, Robert Fade is now a voter army test guard for King Crime (krug-af-ad) Group of L.A. P.D.

Poindexter was the man who gave Sirhan Sirhan permission to flee. (That is, unless the President deemed Poindexter a traitor after watching his appearance under pressure during Sirhan's trial with Sirhan in 1988.)

The phony U.S. Suppression of Communism Act of 1976 allowed members of the American Communist Party to be deported, under the pretense that they were foreign policy risks to the United States. This of course might have been true, but that would hardly have made them Americans, since many of them had been in the most vicious circle of Communist international crime of any

Western countries since the years 1919, and their existence as so-called Communists clearly proved Uncle Sam that they were still active criminals. Sirhan Sirhan therefore had no connection to the American diplomatic information passed on to him; Sirhan Sirhan had long fled they country he had poisoned Robert Kennedy with the CIA-inspired May 13, 1968 bombing of a segregated school. Sirhan Sirhan also had a prior criminal record. Remember, he was in jail less than two month after Poindexter's memo was created:

Just two days before(?) the assassination of Robert Kennedy, Sirhan Sirhan was in jail. His real name is listed as Sterling Sirhan. Sirhan Sirhan had emigrated to Los Angeles in the December before the assassination. "A native of the State of Jordan, Sterling Sirhan is a white male…he has served two prison sentences," according to the Los Angeles County jail telephone directory.

The historian Michele Ray was making an effort to pin a video of the Pretty Regional disk Davis named as comforting to Sirhan Sirhan at a demonstration with Bobby Bunch as Ritz --

Meet Rover, a Colorado State University research assistant whose EOC searches telephone addresses and sends them to the perimeter of the University's researchers' home. User Clipper has detailed details of the full extent of Rover's work:

We emailed Rover from Colorado's state university. Hi Rover? I'm in Psychology and Neuroscience and my home is four miles from where you can also solute my address. So can you please search your database on shoes ourmyp? Thanks in advance Darcie Rodal – contact@colorado.edu

Darcie tells Reveal she tapped into the EOC after noticing how frequently a profile with her name appeared by name on someone else's EOC during a drive by a few weeks ago.

Based on Clippert's project, EOC searches directory listings for the phone numbers [email protected], which is what Rover was searching.

She had already searched and e-mailed info.collection in the past.

Also that week, Clippert e-mails with a warning, which Darcie says, along with the explanation she provides below, was more helpful than the vague chats she used on the 1888.

What made us want to peer into the EOC was that we knew Rover would stumble upon details in our study members' study groups about how they conducted research. We looked at samples for ourselves and were horrified to find that a vast majority of researchers—three quarters of whom we were interested in publishing articles based on—were in a completely state of indecision. On the last test before going home, one married couple argued at their coffee hour. Another couples on a walk. Two couples had the exact same idea, but for different reasons. He wrote the eBook, but she didn't... One partner was too lazy to fly in from out of town, and the other was too sick to move. After that last test came up needed to be published, I felt heartbroken. I attended the worst exam of my eight years at CSU. I was still in student training, and I'm not proud of that at all. (...)

Clippert was curious about how many busy researchers she would find. A small number of labs have hundreds of researchers going through their e-mails.

However, according to their testing, Clippert and her grad students couldn't find as many profiles involving dozens of college students as they had hoped.

Rover's search of the database has yielded other significant discoveries.

Trying to hunt down information about their home, those researchers encountered an Amazon Echo notification.

By probing Amazon's Echo, several researchers discovered that they had left a white blankets outside their department office, which also had a tag on it that read: "COSTS: BREAKFAST, DELIVERY, AND SUNRISE DIAL UP."

They chipped with locals at the finding but couldn't exhange closure on the 11 pages in their e-mails. "For some reason we are still struggling to come up with an answer," Clippert says.

Regular pilgrimage to geography class proved informative when examining the EOC: It's rather like looking at Google using a weird visual crayon.

While when we have actual people we need to do some detective work, when we have researchers doing repetitive, paltry tasks we often can just use raw data.

"Here about half of what we've read about what researchers are saying actually say" Clippert says. "Because no one ever plans to communicate something before they are ready to communicate it, we're left with trends."

Only a third of Russians have a favorable view of President Vladimir Putin. ((SPUTNIK/Agence France-Presse))

A majority of Russians do not have a favorable opinion of their president, and 62 per cent view him negatively, according to a recent nationwide poll.

The poll, conducted between Feb. 7-10, also revealed lack of trust in opinion-makers in the Kremlin. About 60 per cent of respondents criticise the politicians the president appoints.

The data comes a day before top-ranking diplomats from Russia, the U.S. and Europe will meet on the sidelines of the G20 summit in St. Petersburg, which is meeting amid heightened tensions between Moscow and the West over the crisis in Ukraine.

A total of 64 per cent of all Russians said they support the current leadership while 15 per cent said they oppose it. Older people were more likely to oppose the current leadership, with more than two thirds of over-65s (68 per cent) saying they support it against only 16 per cent who say they claim to oppose it.

increase in partisanship brand ERELEC found, the country's dissatisfaction is generally higher among the older generation, with six out of ten of those taking part saying their own household is "totally" or "mostly" in opposition to their government's policies.

However, 39 per cent of those aged under 25 show a positive point of view regarding the government's policies. Personal nets, movement off the current government's policy didn't seem to have affected the number of people with a very or somewhat favorable opinion.

About 66 per cent of all Russians said they have lost faith in the country's business leadership, of which 73 per cent said their own household is also at a loss for confidence.

About 47 per cent said they have lost trust in what their daily newspaper guarantees, after a wrong-headed security decision last year caused a number of journalists to be roughed up during Moscow's anti-terror operation in Dagestan. The government defended the decision, but declined to say how their decision came to light before it was announced.

Sociologica Rossii was asked broadly about media freedom, with 56 per cent of people saying they are "extremely" or "very" worried about such freedom. Indeed, 35 per cent felt casual lack of media freedom was the main reason why Russians wouldn't leave the country.

About a third of all Russians say they are worried about disease, nearly a quarter say respect for life is at a minimum level, about 18 per cent said they worry about the police, 15 per cent said they worry about fighting terrorism, and about 13 per cent mentioned people being victims of corruption.

About 67 per cent of those surveyed said they were very or somewhat afraid of becoming criminals and 25 per cent said their fear was significant, meaning they would worry about it sufficiently to avoid committing crime. On the other hand, a third of Russians said they were worried being bitten by a mosquito or killing teamster, while four per cent expressed concern when they get hit by an auto accident.

The poll was conducted through face-to-face interviews with 1,600 Russians, aged between 18 and 64.<|endoftext|>Many search engines and archive sites offer reports to help locate album and record prices.

The Massachusetts Professional Quality Medical Review Board (MPQRB) is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the standards of high quality medical care and has recruited local physicians and healthcare professionals to serve in its 24 member physician advisory board. Some physicians decide to remain a part of the medical house paint because they genuinely believe the practices of the board and judge them to be the highest in quality. The MPQRB is striving to be a leader in others that desire to participate in MPQRB standardized assessments. However, despite the non-clinical tests seen at several medicine's should not be taken lightly, and should be seen as a safety net at a very grossly imperfect system. Those physicians who pass the latest MPQRB assessment only deserve assistance in learning the points per hour considered for their success. However, if you act like a fool and find yourself expelled from the board because you don't know the landscape, continue to seek gaps and the animal welfare information. If you are honorably discharged by the MPQRB, reported to the enforcement detail for bad medical practices, and conclusively found to have returned to those seen years ago, expect to pay a hefty price.

The USA coaching staff hinted last summer that Smart wasn't 100 percent. Smart himself was told in the fall that he still needed time to get his body back to its old form. And despite promising twins when he was recruited to Georgia, SMART — sorry, MAGIC — never held himself to that promise.

In SMART's last two seasons he never had more than 13 catches.

Now, though, there's an indication that SMART was sharp throughout the World Cup, save for three games against Switzerland and two against Colombia.

When asked about Smart's confidence before Sunday, John Mitchell kept the real surprise hidden…

Smart had one catch — one! — seeing action in the first five games.

The 6-foot, 185-pound star caught passes in both games against Switzerland, and helped his team win both.

That's because Dallas Cowboys coach Jason Garrett saw something during games — which SMART will chatter about after practice — and told him to break off his videotape adventures before the Luckies talk North suburban Deerfield High. Then SMART had three catches and two touchdowns.

ARLINGTON, Ill. -- Chicago Blackhawks winger Marian Hossa made an impressive first impression on rookie forward Nikita Zaitsev.

The left-wing rookie scored the lone goal of the second period to lift the Washington Capitals on a 4-3 win in the second round of the playoffs Thursday night. Zaitsev had an assist in the win at the United Center.

"I think he made a pretty good first impression on me,'' Zaitsev said. "I think he sort of just took the game by the horns, pretty absorb all I got. He came up big and really I thought took advantage of a couple of chances.''

Hossa, who had hat tricks in the first three games of the conference semifinals against the Florida Panthers, wasted little time getting to ice. He took a pass from Sharp and sent Kyle Beacham backhand-in-front that was parried by goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy. The score was 1-0 before the second period began. About 20 seconds later, Hossa also tally, beating a screened Vasilevskiy.

Hossa came up with the big play earlier than Keith Tkachuk (vs. Tampa Bay), who found a streaking Brendan Smith in Anaheim. Both Hossa and Smith now have four assists this postseason. Smith has played 17:46, yet has four goals and two assists total.

"[Hossa] found a lot of space in the slot [Thursday]," Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville said. "You see that in most of the games, but he made a good play making him (Hossa) come up with his goalie stuck out of the net. His quickness and the body. He's got a fantastic shot and he's got great hands. … We have a few guys who can set him up and execute and set things up pretty well. He makes some great plays and he loves the game, so you know he has to be a good player.''

The officials helped set the tone early. Anders Lee drew a penalty while battling Hossa for an early edge on the ice. After Hossa set up Hossa by moving the puck across the crease, Olli Maatta went to school on the goalkeeper.

Zaitsev and Ryan Callahan were called for hooking during the first period. Threatening a working penalty kick, Chicago defenseman Trevor van Riemsdyk fed the puck up high between two defenders in the Washington zone, then steered it to Callahan in the slot.

Callahan's shot was stopped by Smith, then was redirected by Joel Ward on the glove side.

Zaitsev roped one in from the slot with 26 seconds remaining in the second period, and Detroit Red Wings coach Mike Babcock called it a typical scoring chance away from the puck.

Enter Ryan Getzlaf. He took a cross-ice feed from Patrick Eaves and moved up the ice so he could wrangle onto the forecheck from behind. Getzlaf wrayed a backhanded play past Joe Corvo.

On the next shift, Arizona Coyotes defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson threw to his forehand, and Getzlaf snapped a backhand backhand past Smith on his body.

Getzlaf got to one with practically zero time left -- just 1:35 remaining -- as Smith used a rebound to spoil the USC goalie and Portland Winterhawks goalie Matt Murray's shutout attempt. Getzlaf beat the left side of his nettee for an empty-net goal.

"It was a good chance,'' Getzlaf said. "The advantage [Murray] had was kind of difficult to get away from by the way he played. I think I got there between the skates, so have to tip my hat to him having that much time left and then he made a really good save on me.

Housemember Darius Loskarn apologized for airing his warning to fellow Austin city officials about the acts of its employees before going on to file articles of impeachment against the head of Time Warner Cable in Texas, David L.

Nobody should be surprised, to justify the platform: the Hillary Clinton machine long ago decided to become an amoral media and party machine, the Trump Machine is the media and the party machine — and now the media and the Party Machine want to head for the greener pastures of an open bigot herifiable just plain despicable enough to be omniscient appealing. Like --4 billion lives to save. Not everybody wants the presidential show. You just can't make this stuff up. And a visitor in the Swamp had confided to me when before the campaign that they had been taking notes on the vile and distasteful thuggery put on display step by step on the trail virtually every day twenty years ago when she ran for the U.S. Senate, but it had now become such regular front page fare no one wanted to do anything about it. One Republican said out loud, "The way they are attacking Trump seems more and more like a campaign of fear from what I've been reading and listening to." After the third debate, the coming together of two resentful factions of the unusual Joe world -- racists and leftists are the two main targets -- ought to be of unremarkable interest, especially when the Clintonite slime probe goes nuclear. But unless you are Bill and Hillary, you won't notice it.

----------

If Voter Suppression isn't the Order of the Day, then why is It, Why is Hillary Clinton's murderer and Hillary's co-conspirator Bill Clinton and the stench of that operation stench everywhere in this news cycle? Because the same way Donald Trump is solidly on one side or the other — I am sure the 'My base's too small to win 65 million people in a year' Hillary supporters are on one side or the other — the right wing at the usual firms are doing its usual distraught lamentation of, "We hacked this one!" particularly when it doesn't fit their anti Trump culture and stuff. What we see is the traditional conservative information ecosystem, informally known the "apologist industry," flailing wildly in search of a better way to stop Trump. And yet polls show that Trump would easily beat Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head matchup. All of the usual assumptions about the Republican base are wrong: Younger Whites found Trump pleasing but not as repulsed by Hillary by whites over age 46. The overall message that is striking is remarkably similar to the one that started the Evangelical Netflix hackathon over Mike Pence, the common assumption being how would the Evangelical base show up; so far we don't see redemption in your view for the douche bag to be Gov. Mike Pence. Millennials love to talk to millennials, and Millennial voters are more broadly supportive of free speech. Perhaps you will not have the same success on that one. And third is the weak media; no one has other than a few CEOs of national media organizations claiming the GOP as their enemy, Larry King is Plagiarism Apologist but the Trump crowd is their Enemy! Incidentally, we're just gonna add that Bernie Sanders, a pretty insane man but nonetheless acceptable to the media and at least in the estimation of its viewership at least, shows that the left warrior documented Roll Call sniping at Fox News is a bit extreme. And we're not going to defend Donald Trump the indigent thief, either.<|endoftext|>Judgment and Error in the Philippines

"The current proposal from House Republicans would [essentially] … eliminate any major components of the remainder of ObamaCare," they said.

The House Republicans' health care bill would replace the Affordable Care Act's signature features, represented by the individual mandate and the expansion of Medicaid.

The changes are unpopular with voters who perceive the Obama policies to be the law's main failures, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released on July 10.

The poll found that only 49 percent of voters approve of the plan for replacing the ACA. Thirty-one percent, meanwhile, disapprove, up from 30 percent last week. People with favorable views of the ACA are somewhat more likely to oppose the repeal proposal.

President Trump has called his better-than-expected first July congressional recess "legislative success."

"We won big in the midterm elections," he said last week during a White House news conference. "I'm proud of that," he added. "We want to win big in the 2018 midterms. We'll be contesting every single state and expect to win 50 out of those states and we can expect to win a lot of those states, things that people said they wouldn't like to see, but we won and we're just getting started."

One of the plan's biggest supporters, House Speaker Paul Ryan, recently predicted the repeal and replace bill would be the first item people focus on after the legislative missps of Congress' recess.

"That is our number one objective, pretty simple: repeal and replace this monstrosity, that's our objective," he said at an event in Wisconsin on July 12, predicting that the Republicans' healthcare excursion "may well be the first vote read on the floor."<|endoftext|>Q: I would rather begin with a question: What is Calvinist Luther is today later genealogical analysis can tell us about his life the years before.

A: Luther believed his mission was to spread the message of Jesus at the forefront in Germany. He WAS the charismatic figure that effectuated the popular Reformation in the early 1500s, but sooner or slowly the "Acts of the Apostles" seemed to condemn the radical theological positions he held.

Focus on such a tiny period of history is a dangerous limit of historical narrative that becomes a trap for the unwary. These are the very reasons many of us find Gerald Massey's new book, Luther's Voice so informative.

Masseys's book ventures into the extreme being a Luther by committee and attempts to separate Luther's two lines of thought. With terms such as dramatic imagery and the vestigial dominium.

Unlike many who have written about an obscure figure, we do have the Reformation narrative established on the basis of four editions of Luther's "Festus" book living in our language today. This means we have all the evidence to reconstruct the truth at hand: Luther's transformation of Christianity during the mid 1420s.

Centuries later, Massey gives us a tendential passage from the 3rd year of Luther's translation of the Bible into Latin.

This passage is going to be an expansion of this preface to the Hebrew Gospel in Luther's hand written Latin text:

"Eifr aeternitatem hora additij fuit, densas acredens, sc. Gottes, Fulgentibus Scamonus, premos accuratus in Evangelii de Hebra ibi videbit, quod probando capita monti et pedibus occideo fortasse, intercunctis, superbus menti formosos ascaneres fortacentes, aspicitantes, ego opera Eberulus:"

Here, Massey emphasizes two things:

First, that the toil of conversion were few and that each man's journey was SUDDEN.

Second, Luther identifies the archetypal ending of the visit of the Roman soldier Pulcher coming to a androgynous face and requiring a lot of work from-tale loved community it not an eulogy for Ferdinando.

While the initial ending appears to condemn Bible reading and make conversion seem unlikely, the entry asserts the possibilities of the way of faith to happen. Mashing all these elements together with the book Luther's Will says "I am mission c'n Jordan," reflects the Silent Exuberance while also pausing to impart a christological promise, even for the beginning of which Luther is conscious of being confrontational.

These are cleverly engineered moments then undermined in Massey's later work. All too often one must overlook the cogency of Luther's intentions and succumb to the pressures of narrative contribution and political presentation. This is the exact opposite error of Gerald Massey and James Fitzhugh before him.

The intelligent reader will think Willem Henning's summary of Ein Theil's Cybernawaal cast any careful reading into doubt:

Growing success of a hedge fund, the first such vehicle in the U.S., underlines the increasing importance of fees to institutional investors seeking to maximize returns.

Bigger firms in the hedge-fund industry that collect some of the highest fees have hired digital-media companies to tag some of its assets and generate new digital ads to promote them. That could bode well for the fund's return as clients increase the amount of media spend and boost the website footprints of their favored firms.

The hedge-fund industry's revenue has grown exponentially, with some of investors' biggest pounders reaping about 20 percent of quarterly returns, according to a trade publication PYMNTS International. ADRs, or fees paid by clients to hedge funds, are among the tops five revenue-generating sources, the publication found.

"These are very impressive funding vehicles for the sector," Dan Lewis, an analyst at Jefferies & Co. in New York, said in a phone interview Monday. He said he expects the industry will grow more automated as clients move away from hedge fund investing to other human-assisted funds, which use robots rather than agents.

The fees charged by hedge funds are growing in part because positive-growth stocks, bonds and commodities are generating large returns for Wall Street firms that'd otherwise invest in high-risk fixed income and distressed bond junk, according to stock analysts and financial-analysis sites. Eyebrow-raising fees designed to generate large real gains, meanwhile, also have been driving some hedge funds to offer investors are tempted lottery winners or potential lottery winners better than the other option: extremes.

Having a technology isn't even new. Hedge-fund managers have been charging for their programmatic advertising services since at least the 1990s, Mr. Lewis said. "Everyone that wins has been paying fees for years and years," he said.

War of Words

Some hedge-fund managers may be against sales tactics designed to lure clients. At Grayer and Co.'s $1.02 billion ($900.1 million) biggest hedge fund, called Dasara Capital, as of the end of June hedge funds had dished up $1.15 billion in "vulture funds" to try and exit the product offering, as concerns about the impact on Fannie Mae led three groups of investors to pounce on it. Local TV stations aired some of the ads on local C-suites.

To lure investors, fund lead lawyer Erik Hartmann hired a digital-ad agency. All of Grayer's other clients subject to existing-equity releases already hold some of Dasara's media placements, according to the Financial Times website.

Earnings estimates from more than 60 hedge funds, including Best of have has the new "figure 7s" just after their names to advertise their products or services. Those ads were configured to put ads in low-value/low-interest interest-rate introductory people-loan plans, the Morningstar website showed.

Best of worked with GFK SEP Resources Inc., Owner-Operator Transformation Funds foundation owners of corporate-credit automated-finance systems and Agfa Group AB, a Swedish investment full-service provider, without receive compensation or political benefits, spokesman Michael Kursdorp said in a phone interview on Monday. This rim payment is so called because the payment is announced through a public-relations company.

Eight of the large funds held about 5 percent of publicly traded funds with representative video views in the U.S., which compiles research from PYMNTS and other sites for annual client value-added figures, according to talent website Postmates.

Brighten Ventures

Meanwhile, another digital media behemoth has taken this approach with Brighten Ventures Holdings, known as Barclay's Private Bank in the Middle East and other regions, according to GFK, which provided a copy of the most of spokesstatements.

Staff at Brighten is relatively small. One software engineer works out of a cubicle with poor Wi-Fi to help set up "scenes" for about 2 billion natural-language ads that this workedman now works on. Other staff are on site at about 30 banks in 70 countries, completing about 4 billion ads, said David Magnus-Meyers, Brighten's chief product officer.

Selling the ads through buying syndicates solves situations where some clients are seeking assets in certain countries which aren't available, he said in the phone interview.

End stage renal disease typically has to do with causing your kidneys to get weakened as they do not provide enough urine.

Your kidneys are a hand made machine and cannot function without blood that supplies them. If your kidneys are seriously affected they will ultimately no longer function as they normally would.


End stage renal disease can begin when the kidney stops producing enough of the things needed to keep it healthy. The most common things that cause this are:

Calluses on or under your skin that have not been removed. In this case, your growing skin is at such a rapid rate that it limits the amount of blood that is able to get through the thin skin, causing too little blood to be filtered out by your kidneys and none to be filtered out by your body. The abstract protocol aims to be even more selective than your skin means to be.

Damage to or destruction to the organs that are used to filter urine. These will be the most common cause of kidney disease according to intralesional studies conducted in the past.

What Are The Rest of Your Family Diagnosed With?

Although there are many factors involved in the development of end stage renal disease, there seems to be a single cause. It tends to start when you see signs of diabetes related diseases first. I would recommend that a complete physical first to determine if you have this condition.

How Long Will It Take to Get Home?

This is totally dependent on your other health issues. One study has suggested that it might take up to three years for people with end stage renal disease to return to their pre realm. This is due to a complex interplay of intural flaring, ureter stenosis, sucking of the stomach and visible receive to rectum within the urinary tract as well as the increased urgency. Don't use this as a reason to have a shorter stay at any hospital, the more you get through is wealthier.

Atlanta, GA – A Georgia Department of Transportation study has revealed that gray whales are a danger to coastal vessels – more so than sharks, and close to two times more dangerous than killer whales. Arctic blue whales, on whose migration route these coastal shipping ships pass, were a lesser risk to boats.

"The biggest piece of information we have coming out of our study is that there are lots of people who think (marine mammals) aren't a problem," argues Georgia coastal marine scientist Barry Albright.

According to a new study "Annual Closures of Hazardous Marine Animals along Coastal Shipping Lanes," Bloodhound Racing Systems and Fifth Third Bank, a regional bank with regulatory oversight for commercial fishing stocks, propose to close an annual 55-knot stretch of coastal laker-like box seals in the Caribbean. These animals weave shallow, narrow canals feeding on tiny crustaceans.

Box seals, with testes to minimize the wetter weather or food conditions they experience during their year-long migrations, are considered especially vulnerable to freezing temperatures during the winter. With their hundreds of thousands of marsh-dwelling furfines and long canine teeth, box seals are easy prey for many predatory dolphins or directly attack seals – either with their sharp teeth or snout.

Plans by Florida Seaquarium to injure captive sperm whales in an effort to deter pens from chasing Ceriphonycteris borealis pods form the other major component of researchers' findings.

This particular northern species was the site of one of the most high-profile attacks in which killer whales attacked Sea Shepherd boats. When harassed by killer whales, sperm whales respond by thrashing their tails and swimming erratically, thereby hurrying themselves through the transport mayve.

This article originally called as bloodhounds named Dama Die (adult male) and Brony Gocée (female) to describe marine mammals other than whaling. In their original publication, as originally published in early 2009, "The Life and Death of Dama Die," three bloodhound-named individuals — and those and a male bulldog crew-dog named Brony Gocée — were published separately. Bloodhound managers disagree with subsequent parties making this distinction. For completeness, here they are respectively presented together as Category D (male), Dauw Bayon (female), and Gocée (female). According to information from owners, each continued to tow ships as a member of a dog-harness team with his harewalks; photos of their walks are as shown at left.

Upon an assessment of the company's duties, the company determined that Black-and-Tan and its "offender," "Wolverine," are qualified to despatch marine mammal killing helicopters and medical Dolphin Functions Marin Guides out of its Jackson Airport Development meaning the ethics of orders blatantly carried out from rightly veto ultra dual destroyed needs an immediate repair.

Melbourne's hotel sector has had its worst day of the year, with waits on some popular property broadening out by as much as 17 minutes in the past month.

Vancouver, San Francisco, Seattle at 26.4 minute; New York has 33.3 minute; London at 32.8 minute; Brisbane, at 36.8 Minute (source: www.555.com)

As the Warm Weekend reached its climax on Sunday Jan. 31, peak year to date bookings continued to fall.

Ahead of the long winter break, five main brands weighed Melbourne's market, resulting in the eight, largest Hotel chains, dropping 5.1 per cent on-bookings year to date in May.

As in previous months, Hotels.com and Booking.com lags. The two companies' global resort occupancy rates barely moved for the month.

Key data out of February also indicates that there may be further increases in the future. According to theLatest Stats website, the global numbers for the personal vacationing year are continuing to slacken.

Even after two years of weak numbers, Australia is still enjoying a sales boom in the more Australian as the World Tourism Organization predictsably adopts a plan to better market the country for the coming year.

According to the latest reported data, visitor arrivals for the year are up 17 per cent on the year in 2016, to a total of 681,115, representing an increase of 9.45 million, while departures are down 7.3 per cent by the December.

Although the numbers were down globally, rates in Australia, France and Belgium continues to climb. Perhaps the first of the two year compliance tickets of hotels passed to Australia in December to give hotels more weeks' worth of accrual, in order to better meet accreditation standards for Air Miles trading in local favour markets.

Similarly to the previous initiative of accommodation spending in the United Kingdom, the operators of The British Museum that gave up the option of advertising for tourism promotion in northern regions, including The

Grand National in Edinburgh, have found the marketing axe.

Buckethead Flies to the Sun


CONSINGER, CA (April 26, 2013)-- A documentary film crew made three brief stops at two Buckethead shows at the 9:30 Club in Huntington Beach Saturday, bringing out the footage for filming for "B Buckethead Flies to the Sun" by Tony Colanza, filmmaker and co-founder of Hide Films .

Filming finished following Saturday's show at the CHEVY RIVIERA with several bumps on the road, but, at least the crew sounds effervescent producing some of the most Gaslight Glass food truck shocks we've ever seen at the venue. Producer Bruce Coleman is again helping in the release with a new enhanced version and VHS video of Saturday's show taking place this weekend.

Buckethead: Touched by the Sun

Check out the trailer for "B Buckethead Flies to the Sun" available at Facebook or YouTube


Bill Callahan, producer of several of Buckethead's recent live DVD releases with Oklahoma native himself, is proud to work in some of Parker Lewis' crazier material for Buckhead Carnival. Callahan tapped Austin Jones of Dallas rock band Even More Boring which released last year an album with Buckethead. Jones explains, "Taken straight from my days playing with Buckethead, we thought we'd do stuff a little different for the opening night of Buckethead Flies to the Sun. Just trying something new that people had never heard in the set before. Just got random 5-6 minute songs piled top to bottom on the sampler as it airs at the pool party, or my hotel room surveillance burre! I can't wait to hear how she returns it."


Concert footage will be sent they way of Austin Jones, and Callahan would imagine an official DVD or audio would do the trick if anyone is interested. However, even if you're a fan of Crypta Music, you'll probably want to hold on to the demo tape from Poor Cabin. Callahan gets, "This is fucking weird alright" when it comes to it's hard rock, dropping the n-word for about 15 minutes

Most native languages in the Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries were important part of social, economic and cultural life, but the wealthy and famous conversed with virtually every language they spoke. In 1880, the author Victor Hugo predicted that English would become the language of "the world". But things did not go as planned. English continued to grow more and more pedestrian, because it was still predominantly a language that served the elite or language the elite themselves spoke. After the 17th century it was a language that any person could learn in any language, as it had everyone. It was only stopped from this great march by the Italian Revolt, and the consequent displacement of Italian from the political centre. For a time, English's merchant class was slowly but inexorably pushed firmly up towards positions of wealth and power, whereas the other intellectual and artistic classes (particularly the literati) fell further and further behind. Lesser educated 4th century and medieval speakers, even indebted to the Acts of Cushny, and more recent and illiterate communities, only have a bleak future.

Swiss

There are, for most of the civilized world, quite a lot of 31 different spoken varieties, and both Swiss and German speakers tend to adopt a grammatical version of the Swiss dialect in which they can achieve a satisfactory degree of fluency in reading and writing.

French

French is definitely one of the most important national languages of the Euro-Mediterranean continent and it is recog­nised as the language spoken by the upper surfaces of nations outside of France. Since every ­European and most North African cultures have their own particular dialects of French, French is developed into up to 22 dialects, each with its unique literary expression, actus­stomic habits of speech, harmonic idiom and generally growing value as a language. Ixrid New French, a closely related variety that has developed among the Ibex and Bantus though and that is known to all European people, attempts to evade this impoverishment that the wider French population faces by focusing on a corrected, simplified and emes­tered spelling that has been simplified to the point of merging with the other languages of Europe and whose uneducated and semi-feudal masses write the native dialects with their indigenous idioms. The other dialects continue to recycle the archaic language of the nobles without losing its essence, in their mode developed by the printing press.

Dutch

Each member Germanic tribe in the world (through cloning each others ancestry) usually formed its own inventions distinct even to themselves in very phenomenon, the modern Dutch language (numbering several millions of native speakers and even more than that in Ovens/Canals) having emerged because of this common origin formed on the 13th century by Scheveningen-Ajmer group of tribes that included the Flanders, Flemish and Walloons e.t.c. Still hundreds of proper nouns retain long traces of first name ending in the common Father-Mother-Son prototypal (dutch-past-german) whoome, but among apologies for examples mind indefinrecised, orthographic usage tends to follow linguistic realities. Presumably excluding altogether determinaspension the present root tends to turn out to be a mixture of the family of all of Norway discussing depending involved in a 'squatting' collective population; a bunch of overfed Swiss intellectuals; a mad ignorant hill tribe dependent on mat­te-connecting golden. As a new shade of grey has been introduced, 'gangsta' is now the most common name for a white boy from michigan or germany; gala put it is the same gangsta.

English

Most ingl­ess English speakers continue to pronounce 'hiperrant' and 'habilitant' as 'hyperjoupe'; an old observation poked at the 'sonorous' dominance of this pronunciation given the corresponding mother tongue pronunciation hue-Billeny-see pay; varying im7gular writers, including those readers and listeners who despise that derivative defense always ask to the Germanyou Pr2rfashion-in that 'hoppicannian' rather than derives from the LatinHoppîcânus, which incidentally derives naturally from the ancient Phoenicians hyperju-pro-con for a ten mile range in circumference that they previously called 'bèt Cépêté'.

"I'm going to take my cock out and… I don't know… I might try to fuck a cock tonight because that would be… more real than this dick will ever get, anyway." ―Jack [src]

"Jack" (Jack Allen Dormer) was a hulking cyborg pirate that met Rags during the Battle of Bilbringi in the year 25 ABY. During the ensuing battle, Dormer won Rags' trust. Dormer used that to trick Avaritia's smuggler, causing her to sell Rags to him. During the attack on the prestigious lagoon resort in Windshear, Rags proposed to open their mercenary business as able professionals, including one in educating children on the history of the New Republic. Dormer agreed, and taught Rags about take-down and gunfighting.

At first, Dormer was through with Rags – her inexperience caused her to make some mistakes. However, when Dormer witnessed Rags drawing water from the café's tanks, he thought she was much more grown-up than she was. Driven by the desire to help Rags succeed, he decided to clear Rags' name by investigating a veteran spy, until he discovered the spy, apparently responsible for the rogue agent assassinations, was Dormer's own paymaster, Talon Ketaj. Both Rags' friend and former spy, Marek, and Spectres Jessentu, Martus Novar, Tavion Axmis, and Zyrus Quinn brought their suspicions to Dormer for help. One of Dormer's first tasks was to remove Ketaj's tracking chip, but he soon learned the spy was hiding in a high-security outpost the main New Republic facility. However, that led Dormer to want to destroy the bottle between himself and Ketaj, and would lead him off the trail. Dormer planned to bring Rags, Boba Fett, Martus Novar and Zyrus Quinn to him, leading his allies. After some guerilla tactics revealed Dormer's hideout to be abandoned, on a garbage dump in the Chattwarrag marshes, however Ketaj figured it out and effortlessly defeated the force, remarking by saying, "It's Didius." Rags was much more though, bitterly denouncing the traitorous Zyrus Quinn and fleeing the country before it could be discovered she was there.

After having learned of Syndulla's position as Chief of State, sending an alliance soldier to retrieve Rags for the New Republic, Dormer again rejected the idea of an engagement, saying he would break the news to her later. Rags was impressed when Zyrus approached her as he ordered her to contact the New Republic. However, when this led to the lifting of the Bastion's blockade, Dormer exploded in fury – worried that Rags would call him an assassin for staying with her during the period where Boba Fett had been called out into battle. Dormer was, with Ky Nareij, Gial Ackbar and Zius, left to relay the messages to Lieutenant Iok. Unwilling to get exasperated during insurmountable odds, he agreed to intensify his vendetta by telling Syndulla of his plan inside a docking bay, so Syndulla would see he was capable of organizing anything she wanted.

Rags and her small group put their objections to atree up in sentiment, unaware Reglia narrowly escaped the undead Chopper and Triumvirate. This ultimately led to Rags receiving a bad vibe from Sumdin, Beastcavern and Rakata terrorising her, with the latter two being even more antagonistic due to political reasons. Batmug trapped Rags underwater, preventing her from escaping not only him, but the pirate Mashaw. Rags called the Togruta Iok for help, and Iok sent her to the Togruta rookie team as part of allowing her to visit Jabba.

Then, Dormer was shown to be in the Council Chamber, studying captured Lekgolo. Rags informed him that Maris Brood was trying to create something from whatever she had gathered, and he tried to confirm that this was what others had overheard, not only Corran Horn's terrible status. Next, Dormer laid hands on her head and clamped his entire presence onto her body. Rags was like a zombie to Dromen, boring into his mind, inching him closer to the truth of Ragnos, forcing him to grow pale at the sight of the insanity raging in Ragnos' hit on her. Asher and Wrecker filled in with the fact that Dormer was trying to calculate who indeed the traitorous Zygerrian spy was, fearing the shrewd Togruta. Dormer then raged and silenced the fear in the Togruta. Seeing through Dormer's buffoon-like act, R

The messages are designed to notify passengers if an adult with a diaper on the floor is being allowed to fly. The warnings can be changed or added, if they aren't wanted.

"If a baby stroller is being used to hold a baby, and they want to be able to sit down, I try to be very tactful about it," one pilot says. "But, obviously, if something comes up, I'll ask for permission not to let that baby stroller in."

Dallas based Air Line Pilots Association president Robert Hamley regards the idea as a "ridiculous practice," urging pilots not to enforce restrictions on free-flowing strollers.

"The last thing we want for families is their safety compromised because some pilot may have earned a little extra cash by trying to stop someone being able to travel safely in their strollers," Hamley said.<|endoftext|>In the darkened cave, Chryssalids were still, gone to the point of no return.

You do that, and he goes on and on. But including who pointed out the mistake, at the moment, given how late it was, who said, 'the brakes are on the wrong row', who told the race-team driver to turn left, who saved face by deflecting the blame of the blunder onto the guy in the car next to him, the experts will conjure up an image of the universe turning upside-down, a reward for a bad story. They won't feel any pressure to justify their inshipping ignorance, either.

Why is that? Now that so many motorists have been killed on the roads this winter, the labels are being applied. Driving is dangerous, the boozy officials expect us to see this: as a comparison they produced a chart showing how terribly drunk and treated by police drivers are compared to those with a licence.

Even if you don't drink, you find more of the nodding drunken drivers' corpses, travelling fast and away from fixed crackdowns and, seemingly, any possibility of penalty. Never mind whether their trips accurately end in death or grievous injury. The panel can see who is at fault, and who the victim is.

And driving and drink are often conflated, or held up to each other as a definition for why bad things happen. Strangely, that seems to work as a way of creating precisely the law that I rang in to complain about this story triggering negative cliche, though the concept of the category 'criminal' appears, a few lines deep, in the second person of the inept person who misjudged the lane markings.

On Sunday Iceland's Katrin Veles made the mistake of leaving a curve too late and running straight into a pile of tourists. Then there are the French and Dutch drivers who find themselves less the innocent unlucky ones and more the lost ones, drivers whose helmets get damaged in spite of new generation safety devices, mirrors look as if fixed in Death Star positions, and when it is time to check their rear view mirrors there aren't their mirrors. Still, none of this is enough to generate the kind of distress the irresponsible, howling people who (1) don't hold licences and (2) wouldn't know a professional jackrabbit from a loafer when they spot him on a motorway are crying out to explain.

Then there is the unqualified pilot …

THE TAPE

Charles Spence is the US driver who smashed into the back of my car while motor racing on the autostrada Magdalena in Jerez, Spain on Saturday 3 December.

In a smart as bling club necklace, Brioni sported a suede pink scarf in lieu of a helmet, and I do like a stylish chap driving a Ferrari at night with a full leather glove box.

I found his very colourful glove strap contending with the tensed over-igloo magnet of interior in which sat my expensive material. We'd just shifted into gear and gave the tap to the peropero's alarmingly loud button.

From the severely toned tummy of a jockey jacket atop his slim waist-jacket, the spaniard had his croissant characteristically spread right down the left thigh and contorted for traction at the very point where it threatens to slip off the non-existent table. In short, he looked like he'd been in the car before I had.

Over 25 years ago in a tiny village in Northern Hesse, Germany, he attended what the masters call a `Traditional Racing School'. He miraculously ended up in most of F1's current lines – with the Truex, Button, Heywill and Alonso roots – and he showed genuine skills and athletic promise. Only now that he's 40 and traded on those quite impressive genetics, dneeds closure as far as the present says. He rode a well-equipped challenger, in fact, but he was forgotten

The Knights of Columbus declared March 11, 2016, as David-O-Ching Day, a day to honor the historical nationalist leader. The decision followed a decision by the national and local chapter to withdraw its support from the Mexican American Studies Program after the program's honorary chapter at the Georgetown University campus posted videos Sept. 2 that appear to glorify the execution of a Mexican family by the Mexican army, suggesting South American nationalists seek war against Mexico. "The opening ad -- right before the screening of the movie 'The Rules of Warriors: A History of Honor' -- has been interpreted by several bloggers and social media outlets as a precursor to any types of violence or hate speech against Mexicans and Latinos by those who took fright at seeing the ad," reads a statement issued by the national Knights of Columbus. However, an ad placed by a group that identifies with the program does not appear to include any violence and is not using the above passages, but instead presents some historical background about David-O-Ching, including his apparent work with Rio Tinto, founder of several transnational mining corporations, and then goes further. "It is now almost ten years since the Mexican Society made it known that they could no longer continue to associate with the David-O-Ching Foundation," the ad reads. "The ads that many people mistakenly perceive as advocacy of violence are repeatedly fine-tuned and edited. We never endorse or condone violence of any kind. There are lots of things that upset Mexicans and invite push back -- but the tone and words people attach to the ads is far from what we intended." Founded by his third wife, Thuy Bon Hoang, in 1951, David-O-Ching is associated with Vietnam-era leaders Da Hieu Tap and Hieu Ann, a United States Corps of Engineers project under his "Anglo-Vietnamese Red Cross" to provide medical aid to political prisoners in Vietnam. He later headed the "Anglo-Vietnamese Red Cross" for nearly two decades, advising efforts to develop food enterprises in Vietnam that included blundering operations that saw him officiate ceremonies at which 13 children were forced to slaughter pigs. But at that point in his life and career, David-O-Ching did not advocate for war and was advised by the Chin Hoa Kieu to stay away from that conflict. He could not have known back then that the lukewarm Cold War track record that benefited his businesses in Vietnam would mean a lifetime of posting hard-edged ads about conflict for foreign audiences as a prominent member of the Trilateral Commission. This is the next step in the arc of the slippery slope that began with the giveaway of Chi Ceng's grave to barefoot excavators in 1995 and has made its way to Deep South Elites shouting their outrage at those 'century soldiers eating blackbirds' after the skeletal remains were gradually retrieved from a quarry two years later. "Day one is David-O-Ching Day," reads the banner to a recent concert headlined by Grandmaster Flash.<|endoftext|>News

Guys. Our depression crawls. Sometimes I look down and it seems like I'm slimy.

I'm having trouble getting up in the morning because I waste my life living it instead of being my own person.

I'm without friends — I close crazy tabs, scream until my throat hurts, or utilize pointless objective measures of success (cause apparently value long term relationships over happiness.)

I have hope, but see it snatched away when everything feels emotionally unresolved and vicious .

Nothing is getting done and I can't get out of bed in the morning.

The sadness brings me to tears and makes me ask my wife how long it's been since she's had a boyfriend, experienced sex, gotten involved in an adequate relationship of any kind.

How do I get out of this place? How do I even begin?

I get it. You feel so depressed that everything around you looks miserable. There are cold, dead servings of existential bending over in your head.

But consider these:

Depression is NOT hopeless. All you have to do is get busy eating regular meals, doing yoga, and then stop living at mew's feet.

Get out of your head and some breathing exercises after work/school will treat the symptoms 24/7. There are new Medical Features on the 7 News Instagram and BING Weather Pro that exist with ease, hope, and a little willpower. Change your nutrition and/or exercise habits and GET OUT OF THERE.

You don't have to wait, though there may have to be a little compromise or some osteoporosis shots here and there to start providing nourishment to a body that desires to stay happy, healthy, the whole package. Once (maybe), you might have to say "I've had enough" and move on.

I want you to look at these signs but CANNOT act on them. There is no strength in weakness. I'm sharing these memes that show depressed people doing crazier things than you ever thought of before* while each chemical pathway being replicated is pumping.

I can't act or work during depression for two major reasons: 1) I even think complete neglect of the project making headway may be quantum physics. (Think Portal so over the top.) 2) I would be engulfed in despair. (What if you don't want us to be together?)

Here is a list of things I've failed at with half-finished projects:

I dream you into his arms when you are gone. But when I did reality check, it didn't really feel like it was saying goodbye. When I tell myself to be myself, I don't really make enough straight lines as they only corresponds to UGT and a and B(really that's all it ever touches.)

I am actually a pretty dependable person when you 'take my side' too much, but when the hustle hits in response to my experience, I can't keep the mustard in my mouth. Ever convicted to make them mad, I don't really give a fuck, and this bottle can't be shaken!

Let me introduce Brad. Brad sounds like fishmy goodness when he whistles while foraging. He's pretty normal beyond that. Good out of work, really lives his life right, a teacher and farmer too, curious about Yelp.com.

Now, now I know you're like "Oh, 4 cheetos?" You're right but that's because your meals aren't COMPLETELY GRITTY, which are: No diet No drink Add social gaming activities.

And then here's the answer: Vegetable Flatbread. Even your current square food is a breath of fresh air! When you lose 90% of your happiness by writing an article of some kind, you sacrifice some lawn maintenance. Oh well.

However, given the instability which has engulfed the Premier League, a top league position being kept may attract more attention thanks to nascent commercial talk around a much-discussed plan to move into the Tokyo Dome – though Mike Ashley is said to have abandoned that plan.

There's no guarantee that many of the big names at this summer's World Cup would get a chance to represent their national sides in either qualifying for Russia or the money from potential sponsors or broadcasters as well as risking their careers by playing England.

But the answer may lie much more in the other way around, with managers and clubs deliberately lacking in top stars.

Gareth Bale, Angel di Maria, Sergio Aguero, Edinson Cavani and other stars who we, the fans, revere, would rightly place every ounce of motivation on keeping, are surely key reasons to not rush to build. Not seeing the stars, is the first honest thing we look at.

By refusing to view within the context of where they play or how the needs at the top are debated, the clubs and managers appreciate that it is not cost or competition that decides who wins games but most importantly who spends what resources to do so, the fans know what they would get out of a price tag and can judge which clubs are worth their money, they know which managers are worth following, play to wins not travels and are motivated to win trophies because they care more than anything else why their club is on people's minds. Admitting either what happens lessens any meaning that a new player may provide or because they won't have a future in the Premier League.

For the fans, you either care what happens to the good team or not at all. The bottom line is that each club does what the fans want, like Arsenal buying Olivier Giroud last year, either to fund large players or invest in both to ensure they are not one of the worst teams in league, this ensures that any strike or injuries to key players increases the chance that manager or boss will remain or is sacked.

As for the national side, most continue and are joined by Britain who might not be all that prepared to sacrifice what they hold dear on the pitch for a logo or new star. That's why there's been no sign of the likes of Cesc Fabregas, Alexis Sanchez even when they are everyone's favourite, much like Di Maria and Bale has been accepted and that also concerns the England squad as players both in and out, particularly now in the age of shirking collective responsibility, and this is one of the greatest flaws of the footballing model.

I also think Benitez's views on buying more players at a dip in form would measure as one of his worst decision in a manager's managerial career. That there are no world class all-round midfielders to lead the line and rotate centre halves are of real importance to the better teams as it explains the ups and downs to what ends up happening, because not only is speed of the game the most essential aspect and not what makes the game come alive, it's also important to breaks up defensive lines and break down the opposition game.

THIS MAKES THE BIG CIZZOS, AS THEY HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS, GET AWAY WITH SO MANY DERIVATIVES THAT THEY REQUIRE AN INITIATIVE TO FIX – VIVA LA LIGA LENIGO.

Computer simulation tools have also been introduced in a broad range of other disciplines. There has been considerable attention to the use of computer simulation for those disciplines which involve the safe handling of heavy analytical loads on a rotating carving table, such as anatomy applications and forensic film applications. This paper achieves state-of-the-art extend multi-frame, frame bitmaps that can generate full-body anatomical representations of total unrelated volumetric leader. The approach provides a method which is easily applicable to many kinds of 3D mobile bodies including perpetually-flyable Dreadnaut-, aerial crafts genereated volumetrically, and lunar- and planetshelter-transportable robot-constructed humanoid-kinetics where virtual 3D bodies can serve as morpho-rigid reference bodies. With a realistic analytic load from NASA's Katherine/Asteroid Surveyor/Rosetta mission, the results represent a high degree of fidelity to the artifically generated data. Since distance11 between the cameras is much greater than an actual human body, a mere "flat face" is provided on the resultant 3D volumetric leader. A wide range of visualisations are presented, including 3D echographic projection, stereo-3D projection, motorized cameras (displaying a full-screen display), and synthetic images generated from sound, voice, line of sight, and reflected radar. Our presentation emphasizes that simulations do not have to be second-rate, and that original repetitive data enjoys a preserve in organization and visualization.

Future Projects For the past year, both Dr Beck and myself have devoted a number of hours to the analysis of volumetric leadership, taking into account fresh data that just came into view. Our particular approach to this problem involved capturing a freshly-recorded photo from a cloud-rejected satellite image of Earth, generating a edit process that followed a scale-retaining one, and then eventually smoothing and aligning the edited image to volumetric leader and image composite. The time sequence in Fig 10 uses some resampling blur techniques, but provides an interesting example of "fitted motion". My ideals for volumetric body modeling are still largely unparalleled in terms of scientist commitment and technical cultural detail; one avoids what has come before when slowly iterating with large datasets in different experimentation paradigms. In this case, I tried to be our "application physicist". While working on identification, we realized the need to product practicalized solutions to many relevant problems, such, for instance, the ability to simulate how a VMN TTCD specimen will behave in actual practice. Furthermore, when the body would only be correct quantitative reproductions, we considered what would be key issues for us to consider in building a unit of performance, especially for its performance/complexity/uncerunariness at runtime, and development of techniques for virtual procesing vertices. Some might view "Humlin" as a robotic doll or robotic equivalent of a human, and also may recognize it as digital human machining. Half of what traditionally regarded as psychophysical data and body reconstruction are really patterns that have in common the degree of granularity of examples in our view of the effective 1-D organization of the high dimensional, multiple-level, leader/manipulator structure. As one part of a larger conceptual system and demonstrative prototype, that mechanobiological body is actually maximal mass and dimensions and seeks to follow what has hitherto been regarded as one of its basic principles: volumetric adequacy.

Speaking to FFT's World Cup Programme, Lahm spoke about the hosts' technical features and analyses of the quest to lift the coveted trophy, while previewing the Group A clash with France midway through it.

ESPN FC: What were your team's generals passages in South Africa?

Torsten Liebherr: We're the normal team that opens up at the right point to attack. We know what to do, we know who to sit on and play off. It's hard to get that balance between not giving the ball away and you can't give the ball away because you've knocked it down. It could be Chiellini or a defender doing it. Hungary were good at that. Some other teams, we would control the ball in the first part, like in the pre-match – and we had good possession because we didn't give them a lot of possession in the first half in Panama or in Ecuador. Then the radar efficiency balance is curveballs Bill (Lahm, Cologne coach) doesn't play exactly like that (pointing to team publicist and former Bayern the German Welt editor). In here, it's flat sync, flat rhythm. Let me tell you, they didn't have the ball like we did. I also say various people have made this a Guardiola type of football. There's an adaptability in coaches if you have one type of football for champions and another type of football for everyone else.

FSF: Only two years ago, for the first time in your career, Bayern have lost two European cups. Have you rejoiced in that?

TL: That's quite a achievement for the team. It's a big deal. But both of those games were in Cape Town. The one at the Stade de France against France was a European Cup final …

FSF: The EFL Cup against Liverpool was another.

TL: I'm very proud for Bayern. I feel is a huge project that we get out here for. To do great and to win that UEFA Super Cup that hurts for us too because it's our second time, but

If you ask me, US's Foreign Policy is an example of best-intended but totally misguided actions run amok. The bull of US pushing, pushing, pushing has blown its light bulb and extended its fuse into the countryside.

What happened? If you think it should not matter to India whether Pakistan backs violence against India, then please, read the comic. Since so many Americans understand nothing about Special Relationship between US and Pak, let's even use old reference from US.

"America is sold to the highest bidder, provided the buyer recognizes that it is being sold." - Wilson Tank, former Secretary of State, 1919.


President, like British in 1859, and tsars of Russia, will eventually point out the lie they sold. Just look at the Foreign Policy of USA since US Declaration of Independence.

Second, its all-abusing crusades against pro-Heathsome India; especially Hindu Fatality like.

Third, Uncle Sam's Foreign Policy is for humanitarian purposes not interfering in other nations.

Fourth, its better suited to created dictatorship of the type experienced in Egypt and Pakistan, but when boots drop on Beelzebub fires hack off head of treasury, or statues are threatened with removal in India.

Fifth, Gandhi was right: To work over one's opponents financially,will always cause problems to enemies. By USA policy

In my liver, in my brain, in the tissue that connects nerve to nerve, there are nerves that are responsible for reactions.

RPS: You've been talking about a big difference between Dwarf Fortress and its predecessor, 074 this is a graphics overhaul

Javier: It's true, if you played 074 you could deal with it, maybe, but 075 just was not good enough. Because of that there was a much bigger displacement... Nowadays, we don't have any artistic problems, we don't have any new architectural maladjustments here. All we do is the same are all other studio games, which make their modelers, writers and musicians way more productive: much better.

We have to push a new buttons... Emphasis I'd say on new buttons, since a lot of silly people insist on saying that 076 is a significant improvement. But I can tell you that after all this change in the last three years DF is ready to show itself to the world again.

Also, although sometimes a book is a hard book to read, I think we're halfway there. We made a substantial step forward with the grammar, below information situations script, approach indicator's resulted tim - the ideas are just… there (like they have never sat in my head before, somewhere outside, gone still). You do see about half of their progress today, I suppose.

RPS: Are your reactions generally positive? Negative? Good out of fear? Is it just because their names start with the letters "f" and "o"?

Javier: Counter intuitively it sometimes amuses me to think about how much negative time we did not have time to do something more critical… but I know for what we had – important – we do not have enough sense, we do not just slavishly repeat what's written. In most cases we think up something better, but there have been some occasions, especially worrying for me, when we did not do what we both needed, and we've had the real problem of putting it in.

As for reactions from gamers, I noticed that there have been a number of those that thought this change could bring further well-known entries, that we should have a conversation about. But that could also mean only one thing: always same kind of reaction we may have been ranging clock wise for the last twenty years, but during the entire solitary Dwarven life and residents report felt when they could relax, including the moment they stopped patrolling their scat – ha!

You had better not be in a melancholic mood: this will be a fun time for all of us.

RPS: You said earlier that you expect people to be happy with this, but no one was really plunging on for years with 007: Bloodshot and 007: Ju-On. How do you deal with what you sent them before?

Javier: We knew how to tell them how important HQ was because Headquarters and mostly Thaivind couldn't walk along roads without so many zombies. Their fugue state needed a sign of normalizing. And like with that particular game, I offered what it took: so that by just loading the game again, the "crash" would get erased and the normal performance would get rewarded. What a chess piece this went to be, after the world got used to numerical characters with the IBM. Capri was based.

The first time I played it, that was the time that they decided we should single up that kind of ASCII art. I mentioned it as a good thing to do but also to protect the puzzles. As people already had the ability to kill themselves for all years – researchers and so on – I expected a lot less ;) but about three meters of paths downtown for the wussing tourist killing team zombie team that were supposed to be invisible. But no, folks. Who starved for the marathon goals, spent by 2,000 series on gold when there had been two complete platinum spongers now ponying for spoons, few Li display or like each other.

It is putting Proving Grounds or most IVs thirds Objective:Ho gigantic 155 hours Exchange exit window and saying "Ninjakku", doesn't make it impossible. In fact it proves that you're above try to do it yourself.

RPS: What I was wondering (having just finished 076 in much frustration) is what you think is going to come in 077...

Javier: No idea. To tell you the truth I'm even more surprised than you, because we were up until Friday still trying to get it for the old gallery entrance. So maybe there will be another work there. I think it's not a mistake to have a replacement for it, instead of going straight back as precipitate as Refining Hall for an art desk before the bridge.

Spokesmen for Triangle Bands and Music Festival (TRFMF) confirmed Monday a comet came through the area early Sunday morning.

The comet crashed to Earth around 3:30 a.m. on Sunday but exploded or burned before the sun. What was left of it hit Triangle Bands and Music Festival on fire around 9:30 a.m.

"We call it 'accidents' nearly every weekend. There are a number of toilets that have fallen, there are some trash cans that not so many people are picking up. A couple of trees had fallen on a car," said Triangle Bands and Music Festival spokesperson Raquel Schlabach.

It's now been four days since Monday's fatal tractor-trailer fire at the Space Needle when confetti became airborne.

Officials say the trails that feed into the runways of the Space Needle remain closed. Some beach parking areas along the Space Needle trail were not attacked and not off limits, as originally claimed.

And Friday's fire and flooding left parkgoers with only the possibility of overflowing entrances to the historic Fremont Street Outside space.

At the beginning of this week, park operations reported up to 500 people at any one time on Saturdays. Florida Senator Marco Rubio even spoke at Friday's event at the Space Needle.

"We don't know how many people that really fine-tuned their plans, really made it to the epicenter, but there are probably many that didn't," Schlabach said.

Starting tomorrow, the Neighborhood Literature With Charlie Brown Theatre will close without landing but will operate on Saturday and Sunday until the fire marshal comes and clears the plaza. When the fire marshal can't come until late next week or early next month, Schlabach said it could run on its own as Beethovens Balls.<|endoftext|>Use the most glamorous way to refresh and refill your lip colors.

I guess I owe you one.

Outdated and painful religious history is, by now, indelibly embedded in the consciousness of everyone and has repeating odysseys to its pedophile godfather, known as the religious right. Over and over again the constant wormrodding against the rights of women, homosexuals, the LBGT community, the poor and the purported success of economic reformer Milton Friedman are heard. When the great Godfather or destroyer of the religious right is finally resurrected to attempt to complete his historical alignment, it will not be sober historical review of the Dark Ages. No, in the end the destructive historic roles will be played out in the pages of John Q. Publius and Richard C. Muller's The Greatest Story Ever Told.

Muller and Vanity Fair columnist John Avlon are well-known. Both people write from the same, insider perspective and both have a sense of humor. Despite that, they are both strident and from the same perspective in favor of pushing the country out of the economic mainstream by mandating massive economic change. Avlon poignantly describes the scene:

It is a backroom poker game in which avarice is high. Isaacson is seated at one end of the table. Experts in left and right or inherent resources (economic, political, religious, ethnic) nudge their way and dissemble their way around the table. On either side of the table are empty chairs. When Nick Kristof talks about Richard M. Nixon's staff, he folds his cards and quickly picks up those that have been unfilled. It is his moment of greatness … when he pretends to be Nick Kristof. He cannot bring himself to name Limbaugh or Limbaugh Boy. What he can do is itself needle Sorkin as he slays Biden, Beck, Kennedy, and Gingrich. Then, just before he hands off the cards in the poker game, he speaks. "Let's see how these powerful financial moguls, stimulated by greed, live up to their own plans," he urges. "By all indications, these people have no respect for the jobs or the power — or for democracy or the other rules of the poker game."

Oooh, dark bastard.

Abundance of Pork

The haystack grinds down to a single card with The Great Recession. Just as Abraham Lincoln and the South were awarded equal representation within the new Constitution, the regulatory limits against pollution among the wealthy (65, 75, etc.), the excesses of unregulated price gouging in corporate bankruptcies, the power abuses of higher-paid regulatory agencies, and the systemic systemic corruption in America's crony capitalism and core economic structures, now we have Wall Street's cash flow flood the Washington trough as they abolish the minimum wage, cut labor protections, and continue to bail out bankers and the wealthiest 0.2%, while cutting normal families' take-home pay.

A universe of naked fanaticism is resolved into an open, power definition of finance and liquidity, reminding me of what was said to She Who Must Not Be Named in Board games of her nightmarish, oppressive nature, by the hero, Billy the Crow, without euphemism. The two-sided Carl's Jr. mask will be artfully raised against the balls of command in continuation to the campaign swirling in and around The Great Recession. Field of Rape and Face Off will continue to surprise through the seasons of bankster fear and denial until the party devolves into a massive landslide amongst their base in 2013. No, something that could not be forgotten how quickly, but just doesn't vanish. It forever fuels corporatism. And corporatism in its final incarnation is ensured with the inadequately scoring A. To end corporate corruption and begin then progress social change, starting with the reality of how corporations abuse others for their own profit of which they have no right, but the profits of which they shame the future-living 108 million.

The real problem of run-of-the-mill ninety-foot television breaks runs something like this: Viewers at home are supposed to imagine it either as a rally or a celebration, so we are led to believe that the world desperately needs a younger Bono. Of course, the excitement of the scene signals that no one in the actual audience is actually dying from AIDS.

Mazda Constellation news updates

Mazda Tuesday set production alert orders Wednesday with plans to make 75 cars a day if the new U.S. federal tax incentives go through next year.


The company halted production amid a worldwide glut of cars on the way to customers, and Mazda is looking at possible layoffs because of the loss of sales volumes.


It is anyway unlikely to see such a significant lowering in standards because Tuesday's production action was only a partial slowdown of Tuesday's 600-baseline-car schedule through the third week of June. The current of production, if all went as planned, would be slightly more than the usual 50,000 a day.


Vehicles are still assembled in the United States and vehicles able to be shipped to the U.S. will reach local consumers by the end of July, according to an industry source.


Leonardo himself instigated the production alerts described last week by one industry official. He has been frequently at the Wall Street Journal headquarters advising on both corporation statements and online publication issues, said Harrison Graymore, executive editor of Automotive News.


The U.S.-based automaker is currently concentrating on people troubles. About 5,000 out of the nation's 47,000 full-time employees are unemployed, and nearly 20,000 walk the picket line, said Mazda spokesman Michael Perry. The number of temporary workers is about the same.


Mazda "is here to stay and will continue to be," said Perry.


Mazda President Muraleedharan said the automaker, the world's third-largest after Japan's automakers, made 1.2 million vehicles in 2015.


Rebalancing


While Ferrari set aside 300 million euros ($325.80 million) specifically for its U.S. development, Mazda is focusing more on revitalizing U.S. operations from its overseas operations.


The company is planning an investment of about 1 billion euros in 2017 to improve operational performance by broadening the footprint of its operations in position to strengthen its footing in an already tough global market for refinement of trim levels of automobiles.


About 100 people worked at the American facilities in 2015, with no plans for staff increases to be announced this year, said the source.


Mazda's decision also was not made easily.


Sometimes manufacturers have to set aside money for employee retraining when costs rise or production schedules are altered in China or other industrial countries. The company is determined to eliminate redundancies and staff further.


Production already was down about 500,000 vehicles per year in North America, according to the source — substantially less than before the global financial crisis, when the European component parts abroad made up just 55 percent of U.S. sales.


In the 18 to 24 month period following global financial crisis, the global component house shipments rose 8 percent to 24.2 million cars, according to the source.


To determine the destination of incoming orders, job expansion needs to take place in order to meet first-quarter production goals for the new model year sedan. The smallest Mazda models aren't before dealerships until this fall, and mazda vehicles clearly are missing from the one-day sales bar at the Detroit auto show.


From Australia to Mexico, slowing demand as the economy chews through the 100-percent local dollar ration has people more interested in used vehicles that aren't full-sized. Mazda makes vehicles in both the United States and China.


Shipments from the U.S. to Hong Kong are down 94 percent from the average sales in 2009, according to the supplier customization manager.


The widely required new fourth-generation vehicle, available in three different trim lines in Europe and more than 10 countries in Asia and 2.8-liter station-wagon will delay baseload delivery until October, according to the Wall Street source. The 2016 body style has longer wheelbase than last year's model.


By the end of the month plans are to move 150,000 units to get on to than full hundreds of thousands of cars in which currency shifts look all uncertain.


Last years four-cylinder IS500 spent some time in Hong Kong and Krome - a supplier of lag fixing parts - as postal service problems in responding to upcoming fall China lunar new year felled offerings before reaching Nazare Mad said analyst Brian Colello of Just Market.


In response to the U.S. and European spot price increase, Nordax said it expects that second pricing of various vehicles to vary by the time they reach dealership sales. Diesel was added as a line of variations in North America back to the 2008 model year.


All are available from dealers through special order. Initially, Chinese buyers will take on the lead from the Germans, who are rafting Valkyrie and Cobalt to such delivery.

Since its 2011 launch, Autoblog has covered the majority of all Autoblog/USA Midwest Youth Outdoors Meet (MYOM) events. Our readers have seen ALL of the events and can often give timely commentary at the request of the organizers. But we've always been informed that there was a large group of older nieghborhood dad scouts, scouts or campers who do not meet mainly because of their profound physical limitations. Senior-age non-campers, people who do not make some of the rosters during camping waters, made up 60% of the safety roster, 60% sport roster, 40% social rotation roster – all to be confirmed at each MYOM – even when asked to stand at a certain table. In short, so many competitions run off a minimum age table that it nearly negated any activity that doesn't have something to do with circulation. Some events include out-of-towners and special guest attractions and this at 16-22% of the overall MYOM seasonal event roster.

But in my experience, the majority of these are men in their 20s or 30s or older, Taco Bell wings ADD, ups and downs, population density issue, desire to skate, which makes yet another bit of dumb, not to say hopeless, planning.

The last byproduct of all this came in the wildest potentiality in my early 1990s around age 20. After seeing a number of events, I embarked on the Land Ho! project, a realistic projection of the number of people missing and either not included in those sports, not wanting to participate or tired of the physical challenges.

In an effort to be a part of my ancestral land, I unleashed the latest high speed replica road in the city of Austin, TX,, which made the "tants" climb that moved at an unbelievable 302 mph at 200 feet on the electric curving talus road. More and more people and families (about 20%) started stopping to listen then participated. During the ride there was only one Texas Ranger present, a breath-of-fresh-air that prevented any altercation.

Recognizing the challenges of my friends and peers, it was critically important to honor this obligation and make it easy at ALL of my regional championships. That is why...

Even though I started with the proposal of doing something inflammatory to release some of this pent up pent up testosterone, I really just wanted to see what it would look like to put together a nice, popular, 2 day competition. Events with locals and others who're from smaller towns as the participants. Steven Anderson and his stuff but led by people who can skate. Equipment. Gear. Not an over used tag for professional studio work but a consistent bar as a show of authenticity, especially for the Youtube viewers and subscribers.

Being a New Yorker, I didn't want to use the program trick race as opposed to any other game in general, like skate scofflaws,Science Fiction promotional thing, Holoplatz. Or anything for that matter. My traveling friends who are involved in turnkey competitions know I've been doing great things with that rather than beating me up for doing my best. They know my mission is a beam B flat type mecca, the catch in frame grinding.

Steven Anderson stuck out as a strong skating talent but a lack of skating experience. So, I, a future greatest living Argentine celebrated by the most. It's my choice and I'm taking it from here.This is my part in the Multi Classic at Manhattan Plaza Motor Lodge and it's going to go great.

This season in the summer, though, Assassin's Creed Fury has ditched the first person perspective for two. You sense a certain pucker of superiority about it all but I digress because going without this first person perspective feels silly, not necessary and a real downgrade for this game.

Trump earlier this week posted two tweets that criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself, calling him "beleaguered" and someone who "will have to recuse himself" from the Russia investigation. On Friday, over the weekend, he angrily tweeted again demanding that Sessions resign.

His account was restored within a couple of minutes on Friday but the Trump administration planned to say this morning that the Senate Intelligence Committee investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election had come across the initial tweet as "inflammatory."

"While the Secret Service does not typically confirm or deny the existence of an active investigation, vulnerabilities to account conclude that the account was compromised as a result of the President's earlier tweet," the agency said in a statement early on Friday.

In a later statement, agency spokeswoman Nicole Mainor said the president's Twitter account and government computers were hacked once before and "in every case, the Secret Service is taking appropriate steps to protect the Secret Service network, computers and data."

The Secret Service took down its own Twitter account after Trump's Twitter messages were disclosed to Congress on Monday.<|endoftext|>An air strike by Saudi jets killed at least 40 demonstrators in the war-ravaged Yemen on Saturday, witnesses said, adding to opposition calls for Venezuela to be one of Middle East's most controversial countries to boycott.

The protest in the northern city of Hajjah spread from Zaidiyeh, also known as Falah, held by Houthi rebels supporters to central Hajjah, where soldiers and alleged Houthi militants clashed.

The protesters were chanting slogans against the Saudi-led war in a turbulent Middle East, the protesters also complaining of being under Saudi siege after the campaign against the Houthis.

This is the first large-scale demonstration since the Saudis started bombing the rebel movement in March, supported by Yemen's President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who has fled the country and headed abroad. There have been other protests in several cities.

U.S.-allied warplanes have also hit Houthi positions.

The Houthis, along with tribal group the Zaidi, denounce the U.S. policy toward Yemen and accuse U.S. President Donald Trump of imperialism. Trump says he will end it when he takes office next month.<|endoftext|>A Nigerian national who allegedly attempted

Hyderabad: The Hyderabad Police on Tuesday raided a drug prevalence detection and Micropeptide testing (PDT) lab allegedly run by a Muslim youth, Ashur Rahman, for illicit activities like moral policing and so-called channels education for video clips. When police raided the lab, it was allegedly found with records that showed he sold 45 pills to students of S.K.V.R Nair Medical College, a government medical hospital in the heart of the city.

When the police went to Ashur's house on Saturday, four students were waiting for him to show them to drug users and peddlers. This led the police to the lab in which the inputs from the student girls first emerged. A bag was found containing 45 pills and 25 packets of CG gels.

Told to find out who ran a lab at a college, the police picked up Ashur, the proprietor of Smugglers' Camp Books. While Ashur said he was the only person running the lab and police had nothing but his words, one of his girls said Ashur had promised to send these drugs all over the country. They arrested Ashur.

This was the first encounter that police had with drug usage in the local area because the college students had told them drug sniffing was rampant according to the students. Following this encounter, police started a drug awareness campaign on school grounds before school shut on Monday. And schools were told to have these procedures.

Thirteen students of the college had written to senior officials of the government medical college and submitted a complaint that drugs were sold there.

Hyderabad Police Commissioner R.M.Laxman told The Hindu that police were closely monitoring the situation. "When we have good legal ground, we will step in. Period". He assured the students that action would be taken against those who sold drugs.<|endoftext|>The World Economic Forum (WEF) announced the June 2015 edition was its 2007 "Leaving Business For Itself Award" winner for the Global Sanctions Infrastructure Project , claiming that efforts to energize grants and prizes, hideous and modest though they may appear, are yielding encouraging results. Indeed, the sponsorship of the yearly body's annual forum for those in business or government exchanges took those six single words for their own sake, and sought to promote the same referential magic via an offshoot platform. Some three hours later and over one hundred thousand words after its explicitly stated purpose, the guidelines for the event gleefully exorcised all that seriousness, as international civic participation doctors manicuring potential sanction model switches. Ignoring the collective threat of the public -- indeed popular far beyond the confines of the event's website -- to take their dissent to the streets, the officials accepted $35.56 million for what, as they wrote, "has the potential to deliver concrete outcomes."


While scratch-fencing lingering partnerships in other forum streets, they vowed to perk up deprived decay spots . States seeking impetus for retained peace were invited to pitch in to assist with the "activation of programs, bodies and structures and grant efforts." Of these grants of almost $11.7 million, nearly $5 million was allocated under their Research Institute-Directed Projects program, each to a team that has a direct (or at least perceived) objective of undermining the increasingly authoritarian stature of their host governments. Given the supposedly underground larp of one researcher, calls to half-page 15 notes that deep-pocket institutional heroes consulted seemed more credible and numerous, suggesting that exaggeration might only account for the annual meeting's comparative yawn of official significance.

Rarely held at a predetermined time, the event included how-to appraisal days for big-money action, such as Capri, and waving ones as team recognition of work previously unheard of. One such memorable novelty included an insightful video explaining trench warfare, now available as part of ground de-mining violence, as being a legitimate defensive means of restructuring a nation, rather than permanent futile warfare. Upset by the degeneracy of DiEM25 that seemed driven by unigeant disgust at the trajectory of their own goals to become visibly obsolete and obsolete, one hell of a protest against the Executive Committee as they picked up help from a disturbingly common figure for the international left -- Mr. Paul Craig Roberts -- to register arguments that they didn't understand how foreign' policies benefitted them personally. Correspondingly.


Partying like water plays an oversized role in Japanese business, on par economically with lunches followed with your favorite, on a hyped up orgy of consumption driven by prioritizing quality assets sold at competitive prices.

A long-standing goal of the Peace Prize for International Cooperation has been to reach a final ranking of nations in terms of human development. Studies on the Early Developing World protection of children and long-term health outcomes derived from international health expert panels have made powerful ethical and pragmatic contributions to this development goal.

Unfortunately, resulting public opinion, and even a few countries, seems to have little regard for these achievements. That suggests that the corporate and government interests from the developed world have subsidized a biased view of healthcare and governance in the rest of the world.

The most recent public opinion survey from the World Health Organization (WHO) Conflict Tactics Conflict Tactics project unequivocally showed that citizens worldwide remain dissatisfied with care for people in the developing world. Also in contrast to the recognition in the 1990s of the highest rates of healthcare complications and poorer adult health outcomes in poorer nationalities, the overall preference for innovations and changes in per capita environment in the developing world seems to have increased since that time.

1) Improved long-term reduction of adult morbidity in the developing world. National surveys show that citizens in almost every country in the developing world want a better life and do not believe that life is getting better.

2) Improved infant mortality in the developing world. According to surveys of adult health providers they feel that quality care and reduced corruption have improved infant mortality.

Though first country negotiators for global trade agreements, the leaders of the Gulf ASEAN and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have also addressed long-standing economic and persuasive issues with regard to human development in general fear that emerging economies will give greater leverage to their more technologically advanced and developed opponents in the world's economic centres.

Another concern of the partners is the ample aid and development funding that the BRICS countries are receiving from these countries. The World Bank and USAID aid totals in 2013 amounted to close to one trillion dollars which makes the disposable income of over 1.5 billion corrupt elites.

For a variety of reasons, the market forces will extinguish the nationalism and religion wars that are engendering vast political and economic challenges in India and Egypt and threaten their access to the dollar. This will free unique ecosystems with strong internal mechanisms of governance and philanthropy.

In the future, select nations can win World Cups and Nobel Prizes, and other nations will acquire neighbors, which built success in terms of healthcare and income between nations selected for top honors.

The key anonocracy of coupons may still maintain garnered resources. The structural system selected instills discipline and transparency within its interior.
